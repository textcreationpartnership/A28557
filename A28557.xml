            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </argument>
            <p>IT was the Misfortune of this Great Man, <hi>John Sleidan,</hi> to die in that nick of Time, when the Fates of the two contending Religions, and of all ChriÅ¿tendom, were juÅ¿t upon the Å¿etling: It is true,
<note place="margin">The Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> he lived to Å¿ee the <hi>AuguÅ¿tane</hi> ConfeÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Å¿etled in the Dyet of <hi>Ausburg,</hi> and perhaps he might hear of the ReÅ¿ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Empire by <hi>Charles</hi> V, to his Brother <hi>Ferdinand;</hi> but then Death Å¿ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized him before he could give any account of it; for with it he deÅ¿igned to have begun the next Book, in all probability, and to have filled up this with Å¿ome other Accidents; Å¿uch as a large account of the Revolt of <hi>TranÅ¿ylvania,</hi> and the Siege of <hi>Sigeth</hi> would have afforded him. But then had he lived till the Year 1563, he Å¿hould have Å¿een the Death of Queen <hi>Mary, Henry</hi> II of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> V, and the Å¿etling of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Religion, by the Determination of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> contrary to the Expectation of all Men; which Å¿eems to be the firÅ¿t Period of the Reformation, and abÅ¿olutely neceÅ¿Å¿ary to give the Reader a clear ProÅ¿pect and full View of the firÅ¿t Joynt of this great Revolution. I have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore perÅ¿uaded the Stationer to add a Suppliment to this VerÅ¿ion, for that purpoÅ¿e; and becauÅ¿e I am a Member of the Religion by Law eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed, and not willing to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51585:3"/>offend them of the other PerÅ¿uaÅ¿ions, I reÅ¿olve to advance nothing in it but from Authors, who lived and dyed in the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> Å¿hewing the matter of Fact with great Brevity, and making few or no Reflections of my own: That Å¿o the Reader may be left entirely to himÅ¿elf, to think what he PleaÅ¿e, and God Å¿hall direct him.</p>
            <p>I will begin with the BuÅ¿ineÅ¿s of <hi>TranÅ¿ylvania: John</hi> the laÅ¿t King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> dyed of Joy for the birth of his Son,<label type="milestone">

               </note> his Mother the Queen Regent, put him under the Protection of <hi>Solyman,</hi> Emperour of the <hi>Turks,</hi> to Å¿ecure him from the Violence of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> who claimed that Kingdom; and thereupon a Å¿harp War enÅ¿ued, which ended in the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>TurkiÅ¿h</hi> IntereÅ¿t, and the loÅ¿s of both thoÅ¿e Princes, the <hi>Turk</hi> taking <hi>Quinque EccleÅ¿iae, Gran</hi> and <hi>Albaregalis,</hi> in the Year 1544; <hi>TemeÅ¿war, Lippa,</hi> and Å¿ome others in the Year 1548: Whereupon <hi>Ferdinand</hi> finding himÅ¿elf too weak to deal with that potent warlike Prince, in the Year 1549 offered him 30000 Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats of yearly Tribute for <hi>TranÅ¿ylvania:</hi> But this DeÅ¿ign failing, in the Year 1551, he forced the Queen of <hi>Hungary</hi> to reÅ¿ign <hi>TranÅ¿ylvania,</hi> to whom in lieu of it he gave <hi>CaÅ¿Å¿ovia,</hi> and a PenÅ¿ion of 100000 Ducats yearly. And in the Year 1552, he made <hi>Stephen Dobus,</hi> who had performed great Services for him againÅ¿t the <hi>Turks</hi> this Year in the Defence of <hi>Agria,</hi> Vaivode of <hi>TranÅ¿ylvania:</hi> He continued qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly in the PoÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion of it, till the Year 1556; and then another DiÅ¿turbance aroÅ¿e in this Principality, which is Å¿hortly hinted at by King <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> in his Letter to the Dyet at <hi>Ratisbonne.</hi> Among other things, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had promiÅ¿ed, That he would not burthen <hi>TranÅ¿ylvania</hi> with any GarriÅ¿ons of Foreigners; But whether out of NeceÅ¿Å¿ity, or for fear of the <hi>Turks,</hi> he had kept a Å¿trong Guard of <hi>SpaniÅ¿h</hi> Soldiers there, who had done great Injuries to the Inhabitants; whereupon one <hi>Peter Petrowic,</hi> underhand, dealt with <hi>Solyman</hi> for Å¿upplies, and began a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt in favour of one <hi>John,</hi> whoÅ¿e Family is not known, who then aÅ¿pired to this miÅ¿erable Principality, and hoped by drawing the <hi>Turks</hi> into <hi>Hungary,</hi> to gain the greateÅ¿t part of that Kingdom for himÅ¿elf, and had called a Dyet at <hi>Thorda,</hi> in <hi>March,</hi> 1555, which was diÅ¿appointed by the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> The <hi>Turks</hi> were not without their Complaints too, for tho' <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had Å¿ent AmbaÅ¿Å¿adours to treat a Peace, yet <hi>Solyman</hi> being engaged in a War with the <hi>PerÅ¿ians,</hi> he was not at leiÅ¿ure, or perhaps not much inclined to make a Peace with <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> but kept his AmbaÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿adours two Years at <hi>ConÅ¿tantinople,</hi> to little or no PurpoÅ¿e; and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> being thus held in SuÅ¿penÅ¿e, was forced to keep great GarriÅ¿ons in his Frontier Towns, and among them the <hi>Heyducks</hi> were imployed, who having no Pay, made frequent inroads into the <hi>TurkiÅ¿h</hi> Quarters towards <hi>Quinque EccleÅ¿iae,</hi> and often Å¿urprized the <hi>TurkiÅ¿h</hi> Boats, as they paÅ¿Å¿ed upon the Rivers; nor was it in <hi>Ferdinand</hi>'s power to reÅ¿train them, as things then Å¿tood. Hereupon the <hi>Turks</hi> began a War with the Town of <hi>KapoÅ¿war,</hi> which was treacherouÅ¿ly reÅ¿igned to them by the GarriÅ¿on, and after it <hi>Babotz,</hi> and paÅ¿Å¿ing on, they attempted <hi>Sigeth,</hi> and came within Cannon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hot of it; but <hi>LadiÅ¿laus Kerezen,</hi> the Governour, gave them Å¿uch a warm Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the BaÅ¿Å¿a's Tent being pierced with a Cannon-Å¿hot, he was forced to remove farther off, and three hundred of his Men being Å¿lain in two Sallies, and Winter coming on, he was fain to Withdraw. This paÅ¿Å¿ed in the Year 1555.</p>

               </note> It is Å¿eated in a marÅ¿hy Plain, and on the North it has Dikes, which bring the Waters of the River <hi>Alme</hi> into the three Ditches, which Å¿trengthen the Town; On the EaÅ¿t it has a Å¿trong CaÅ¿tle, which had two Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tions, and the nature of the Site made it impoÅ¿Å¿ible to make uÅ¿e of Mines againÅ¿t it; and it was then a very Populous Place. <hi>Haly</hi> came before it the tenth of <hi>June,</hi> and finding nothing but Force could take it, the thirteenth he raiÅ¿ed a Battery of nine Canon on the South Å¿ide: WhilÅ¿t this was battering the Town on that Side, he plaid his Granadoes on all the other, which burnt moÅ¿t of the HouÅ¿es, and a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51585:3"/>part of the Walls, which were made of Clay and Straw; the twentieth of <hi>June,</hi> the <hi>Turks</hi> took the CounterÅ¿charpe, and the next Night they filled the Å¿econd Dike with Faggots, and built another Battery on the WeÅ¿t Side of the Town, which the Defendants were not able to deÅ¿troy. The next day, a great Breach being made in the Å¿econd Wall, tho' the Town had burnt ten thouÅ¿and Loads of Wood, which had been thrown in to fill the Dike, yet the <hi>Turks,</hi> after four furious AÅ¿Å¿aults, which Å¿ucceeded not, took the Town at the fifth, and the GarriÅ¿on retreated into the CaÅ¿tle. The <hi>Turks</hi> drew a Trench between the CaÅ¿tle and the Town, to Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure themÅ¿elves; but the TownÅ¿men and Soldiers finding themÅ¿elves too much pen'd up for want of Room, made Å¿o furious a Sally upon the <hi>Turks,</hi> that they Å¿lew eighty of them, and recovered the Town. The next day, which was the twelfth of <hi>July, Haly</hi> renewed the Battery on the WeÅ¿t Side, and that Night ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted a third Battery againÅ¿t a Tower called <hi>Haney,</hi> and a Gate near it, and drew a Trench round the Town to drain the Dikes, which he endeavoured to fill under the new Battery, and in this Work he Å¿pent five Days. When by this means he had drained the Dikes, he raiÅ¿ed a fourth Battery over againÅ¿t the CaÅ¿tle, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to play it with great Fury againÅ¿t the CaÅ¿tle, twenty thouÅ¿and Carts being imployed, in the mean time, to fill the Dikes, on the EaÅ¿t Side with Wood; but the Defendants fired that too, and under the Cover of the Smoak, made a furious Sally on the <hi>Turks,</hi> who were labouring to put the Fire out, and Å¿lew Å¿even hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of them. They made the Å¿ame Attempt of filling up the Dikes, and with the Å¿ame SucceÅ¿s, on the WeÅ¿t Side, the Wood being burnt, and four hundred <hi>Turks</hi> cut off by a Sally. <hi>Haly</hi> by this time began to find his Hopes of prevailing by Force abated, Å¿o he fell to fawning and Flattery, and made them very kind and obliging PromiÅ¿es, if they would Å¿urrender; but this was to no purpoÅ¿e, Å¿o he fell to fill the Dikes with Sacks of Earth, and to raiÅ¿e Works with Skeps to beat off the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants. The twelfth of <hi>July</hi> he raiÅ¿ed another Platform againÅ¿t the CaÅ¿tle, and bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered it with that fury for five Days, that the Town was almoÅ¿t reduced to DeÅ¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and Å¿ent a MeÅ¿Å¿enger to King <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> to beg Relief; but conÅ¿idering how long they muÅ¿t Å¿tay for it, they re-aÅ¿Å¿umed their wonted Courage, and made a brave Irruption, in which they fired all the Wood that had been thrown into the Dikes. This abated the Fury of <hi>Haly</hi> Å¿o effectually, that he lay only pelting the Town with his Cannon to the twenty firÅ¿t of <hi>July,</hi> and then was glad of an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to draw off to Å¿uccour <hi>Babots,</hi> which was aÅ¿Å¿aulted by one <hi>NadaÅ¿ad,</hi>

Upon this Å¿mall Advantage <hi>Haly</hi> returned to the Siege of <hi>Sigeth,</hi> but was entertained with Scorn and Laughter.

That he might have no occaÅ¿ion to proceed as he intended to do, not only againÅ¿t the</hi> Lutherans, <hi>but even againÅ¿t them too, as Abettors of them.</hi> But all this Ranting Zeal miÅ¿Å¿ing its due

            <p>The Pope however, conÅ¿idering that he was not able to deal alone with Å¿o Potent a Prince as King <hi>Philip,</hi> under pretence of Å¿ending Cardinal <hi>Caraffa</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> to congratulate the five Years Truce, imployed his IntereÅ¿t with the King of <hi>France,</hi> to perÅ¿uade him to break his Faith Å¿o lately given, and to renew the War with <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip.</hi> The Pope had before, upon Å¿everal Pretences, clapt up the leading Cardinals, and great Men of the <hi>SpaniÅ¿h</hi> Faction: And when the King, with all the ReÅ¿pect his Zeal for that See could inÅ¿pire him with, by his AmbaÅ¿Å¿adour, deÅ¿ired the DiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of theÅ¿e PriÅ¿oners, and the ReÅ¿titution of <hi>Marc Antony Colonna</hi> to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers EÅ¿tate and CaÅ¿tles in the Papacy, the angry Pope Replyed, <hi>That he had Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Right to puniÅ¿h his Subjects for their Offences.</hi> And commanded his AmbaÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿adour to write to his MaÅ¿ter, <hi>not to meddle with what did not belong to him, and that he Å¿hould permit him as Pope, to exerciÅ¿e his Soveraignty freely on his own Subjects.</hi> And accordingly he Å¿eized all <hi>Colonna</hi>'s CaÅ¿tles and EÅ¿tates in the Dominions of the Church, pretending to revenge the Wrongs he had done to <hi>AÅ¿canius</hi> his innocent Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with the conÅ¿ent of his Mother, who was alÅ¿o Å¿everely treated by the Pope; and not contented with all this, he declared the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> forfeited to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> becauÅ¿e King <hi>Philip</hi> had neglected the Payment of eight thouÅ¿and Crowns due as a yearly Tribute for that Kingdom,

But when the NoiÅ¿e of the taking <hi>Anagni</hi> and the other Towns came to <hi>Rome,</hi> nothing could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿olate
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51585:5"/>the Citizens, but fearing another Sack like that of <hi>Bourbon</hi> in the year 1527, they would not be quiet till the Pope Å¿ent EmbaÅ¿Å¿adors to <hi>Alva</hi> to Treat of Peace.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Alva</hi> took <hi>Valle di Montone</hi> without reÅ¿iÅ¿tance, and finding himÅ¿elf deluded with the pretence of a Treaty, he took <hi>PaleÅ¿trina</hi> and <hi>Segni;</hi> after this he marched to <hi>Tivoli,</hi> which Å¿ubmitted without any diÅ¿pute to his will, who received the City under his Protection, and would not Å¿uffer his Soldiers to enter into it. ThoÅ¿e of <hi>Vico-Varo,</hi> a Å¿trong and populous Town upon the <hi>Teuerone,</hi> promiÅ¿ed <hi>OrÅ¿ino</hi> to defend themÅ¿elves bravely; but Å¿eeing their Fields, Gardens, Vineyards and Countrey HouÅ¿es go to wrack, they deÅ¿ired <hi>OrÅ¿ino</hi> to provide for himÅ¿elf, who thereupon Å¿ent to <hi>Alva</hi> for leave to march away with Drums beating and Colours flying, as if no enemy had been near, which the civil good natured enemy granted, and thereupon he entred the Town; and though he promiÅ¿ed to leave but Å¿ixty <hi>Spaniards</hi> in gariÅ¿on, took the liberty afterward to do as he thought fit. This Town by reaÅ¿on of its GreatneÅ¿s, Strength and PopulouÅ¿neÅ¿s, might have defended it Å¿elf againÅ¿t a greater Army than that of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> if they had had the Courage; and was Å¿urrendered very opportunely for the <hi>Spaniard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Pope began to want Money, but durÅ¿t ask none of the Citizens of <hi>Rome,</hi> becauÅ¿e they were at great charges to fortifie the City: He Å¿olicited the <hi>Venetians</hi> alÅ¿o, to enter into the War, but they were for a Peace between the Parties; but then there was Å¿o much Pride on the one Å¿ide, and Å¿o much Anger on the other, that nothing could be effected. The <hi>French</hi> that were in the City were very troubleÅ¿ome to the <hi>Romans</hi> for want of their pay, which occaÅ¿ioned many Thefts and Robberies, and that in the day time. <hi>Alva</hi> having refreÅ¿hed his Forces a Å¿mall time after the taking <hi>Vico-Varo,</hi> drew them into the Field and took <hi>ToÅ¿colano San Marino, Grotta Ferrata</hi> and <hi>GandolÅ¿o,</hi> and from <hi>Grotta Ferrata</hi> marched towards <hi>OÅ¿tia.</hi> The inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Nettuno</hi> Å¿ubmitted to him, and defended his men againÅ¿t thoÅ¿e of <hi>Velletri,</hi> who aÅ¿Å¿aulted them in the Suburbs of <hi>Nettuno.</hi> The Pope Å¿eeing his weakneÅ¿s, Å¿ent again to the <hi>French</hi> King to declare a war againÅ¿t the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and at laÅ¿t obtained his deÅ¿ire in that point.</p>
            <p>The Duke <hi>De Alva</hi> coming before <hi>OÅ¿tia</hi> (this City was heretofore a very conÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable place, but being ruined by Wars and time, and now almoÅ¿t deÅ¿olate,

            <p>In the mean time the Pope finding the inconvenience of having <hi>OÅ¿tia</hi> in the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies hands, which deprived <hi>Rome</hi> of the benefit of the Sea,

            <p>In the Spring the Duke of <hi>GuiÅ¿e</hi> began the War with the Sack of <hi>Compli,</hi> a Å¿mall City of <hi>Abruzzo,</hi>

               </note> which being taken by Scalado was Å¿everely treated; the Spoil of this City was eÅ¿timated at two hundred thouÅ¿and Crowns, great part of which was found in the Ruines of the City, where it had been hid many Ages, and was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the Inhabitants. The 24 of <hi>April,</hi> the Duke of <hi>GuiÅ¿e</hi> Å¿at down before <hi>Civitella,</hi> a City of <hi>Abruzzo,</hi> built upon an high Hill, and very Å¿teep on the North, on the top of which it had a CaÅ¿tle, ruined by its own Inhabitants, in the time of <hi>Charles</hi> VIII, for fear it Å¿hould have been GarriÅ¿on'd by the <hi>French.</hi> This City would not yield, and therefore the Duke of <hi>GuiÅ¿e</hi> was forced to Å¿tay before it till the Cannon could be brought from <hi>Ancona</hi> and <hi>Ferrara</hi> to batter it; but when all was done, this Å¿mall place, by the nature of its Å¿ituation, and the Courage of its Inhabitants, baffled all their Attempts, and forced the <hi>French,</hi> after a long Siege, to retire, and leave it. The Women of this Town contributed very much to the Å¿aving of it, not only by working at the Breaches, tho' many of them were Å¿lain by the Enemies Shot, but alÅ¿o by taking mens Cloaths, and appearing in Arms among them in the Å¿ight of the Enemy, Å¿o that the Defendants Å¿eemed more numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than indeed they were.</p>
            <p>In the mean time,
<note place="margin">The Duke <hi>de Alva</hi> takes the Field.</note> 
               <hi>Alva</hi> having brought an Army of 16000 Foot and 2000 HorÅ¿e, conÅ¿iÅ¿ting of <hi>Spaniards, Germans</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> together with a good Train of Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery brought him by Sea, he marched out of <hi>PeÅ¿cara, May</hi> 10, and drove the <hi>French</hi> out of <hi>Givlia,</hi> a Sea-port-Town, about ten miles eaÅ¿t of <hi>Civitella;</hi> whereupon the Duke of <hi>GuiÅ¿e</hi> having loÅ¿t above half his Army, left <hi>Civitella,</hi> the 15 of <hi>May,</hi> when they had lain before it twenty two Days.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Florence</hi> took the Opportunity of this diÅ¿tracted State of Affairs, and by pretending he was much inclin'd to joyn with the <hi>French</hi> and Pope againÅ¿t the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> which would certainly have ruined their Power in <hi>Italy,</hi> forced King <hi>Philip</hi> to give up the City and State of <hi>Siena</hi> to him, who accordingly took PoÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion of it <hi>July</hi> 19.

            <p>Towards the latter end of the Summer,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Segni</hi> taken by the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Segni,</hi> a Å¿trong City of <hi>Compagnia di Roma,</hi> having made the beÅ¿t Defence it could, fell at laÅ¿t into the Hands of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who plundred and burnt it, and Å¿lew the greateÅ¿t part of the Inhabitants. When the Pope heard the deplorable News of the Sack of <hi>Segni,</hi> he fell into a fit of Melancholy, and Å¿aid, <hi>He deÅ¿ired to be with ChriÅ¿t, and would with great ConÅ¿tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Satisfaction, expect the Crown of Martyrdom,;</hi> As if (Å¿ays <hi>Thuanus</hi>) this had been the CauÅ¿e of God: And that he had not been brought into this great Danger and Trouble, by a War which his Relations had involv'd him in, with great RaÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s and Ambition.</p>
            <p>ThoÅ¿e that were about him could not forbear Smiling; and knowing very well, That as the Pope had begun this War without CauÅ¿e or Provocation, Å¿o he might end it when he pleaÅ¿ed upon JuÅ¿t and Honourable Terms, King <hi>Philip,</hi> and his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, the Duke <hi>de Alva,</hi> being both extremely addicted to the See of <hi>Rome:</hi> And therefore taking this Opportunity, they perÅ¿uaded the Pope to Å¿end <hi>Alexander Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidi,</hi> a Knight of great eÅ¿teem, to the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> to treat about a Peace, by whom alÅ¿o the Cardinal of <hi>Sanfloriano</hi> Å¿ent a private Account of the beating the <hi>French</hi> at S. <hi>Quintin,</hi> which as it Å¿unk the Pope's IntereÅ¿t, Å¿o it raiÅ¿ed the <hi>SpaniÅ¿h.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this the Duke <hi>de Alva</hi> took up a ReÅ¿olution to Å¿urprize the City of <hi>Rome</hi> by Night, and treat with the Pope within the very Walls of <hi>Rome;</hi> and he came very early in the Morning under the Walls of <hi>Rome,</hi> and found the City in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Quiet, and altogether unprovided, Å¿o that in all probability he might have Å¿urprized it without the leaÅ¿t ReÅ¿iÅ¿tance; but as he took an Oath of the Captains, That they Å¿hould not Å¿uffer their Soldiers to plunder or Å¿ack the City, Å¿o it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily thought, upon great ReaÅ¿ons, That his Fear the <hi>Switz</hi> and <hi>Germans</hi> would have done this whatever he or his Officers could have done or Å¿aid to prevent it, made him Å¿top, and by his PreÅ¿ence try if he could affright the Old Pope into a Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. However, <hi>Thuanus</hi> is of Opinion, he truly deÅ¿igned to Å¿urprize the City, but that his Heart failed him, when it came to the Point of Execution.</p>
            <p>At the Å¿ame time there came Letters from the King of <hi>France,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>GuiÅ¿e</hi> recall'd.</note> to recal the Duke of <hi>GuiÅ¿e</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> where his PreÅ¿ence was abÅ¿olutely needful, and the Pope had his HoÅ¿tages returned, and was left at Liberty to take the beÅ¿t care, he could of his own Affairs: Yet when the Duke of <hi>GuiÅ¿e</hi> came to ask the Pope's leave to return, upon the account of the great NeceÅ¿Å¿ity of his MaÅ¿ter's Affairs,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51585:6"/>there was a Å¿harp conteÅ¿t between the Duke and the Pope, inÅ¿omuch that his HolineÅ¿s told the Duke, <hi>He had done very little towards the advancing his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters IntereÅ¿t, or the Good of the Church in this Voyage, and much leÅ¿s for the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of his own Honour and Reputation.</hi> In the mean time the Duke <hi>de Alva</hi> withdrew his Army to the Town of <hi>Colonna.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Florence</hi> had now obtained what he deÅ¿ired,
<note place="margin">A Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween King <hi>Philip</hi> and the Pope.</note> by gaining the State of <hi>Sienna,</hi> the Duke of <hi>GuiÅ¿e</hi> was gone for <hi>France,</hi> the Pope's Forces were Å¿ufficiently baffled, and his Towns lay at the Mercy of the Enemy, his TreaÅ¿ures were Å¿pent, and the <hi>Venetians</hi> had abÅ¿olutely refuÅ¿ed to aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t him; So that the Pope was now forced to come to a Treaty of Peace, in good earneÅ¿t, and it was well he had the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and the Duke <hi>de Alva</hi> to treat with, conÅ¿idering in what State his Affairs were.</p>
            <p>The Peace was however agreed at laÅ¿t, upon theÅ¿e Terms. I. That the Duke <hi>de Alva,</hi> in the Name of his MaÅ¿ter, Å¿hould beg the Pope's Pardon, and it Å¿hould be granted. II.

IV. That both Parties Å¿hould remit all Wrongs, Injuries and LoÅ¿Å¿es SuÅ¿tained during the War, and Pardon all that had taken Arms on either Side: And that <hi>Paliano</hi> Å¿hould be put into the Hands of <hi>Bernardo Carbone,</hi> a KinÅ¿man of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raffa</hi>'s, to be kept by him for both Parties, with a GarriÅ¿on of eight hundred Men, till they Å¿hould otherwiÅ¿e diÅ¿poÅ¿e of it by mutual ConÅ¿ent.

            <p>The Duke <hi>de Alva,</hi> in a Å¿hort time after went to <hi>Rome,</hi> and on his Knees begged the Pope's Pardon, with as much Humility as could have been wiÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And the Pope abÅ¿olved him and his MaÅ¿ter with as much HaughtineÅ¿s as ever need to have been uÅ¿ed.</p>

               </note> but dyed before he could give us any account of the TranÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions there: After they had conÅ¿ulted of thoÅ¿e things which related to the State, and the <hi>TurkiÅ¿h</hi> War, there aroÅ¿e Å¿ome debate concerning the compoÅ¿ing the Differences of Religion. And here it was firÅ¿t agreed, That all that had been done in the Treaty of <hi>PaÅ¿Å¿aw,</hi> and the Dyet of <hi>Ausburg,</hi> concerning the Peace of Religion, Å¿hould remain firm and immoveable. But then thoÅ¿e of the <hi>AuguÅ¿tane</hi> ConfeÅ¿Å¿ion, preÅ¿ented to King <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> by their Deputies, a ProteÅ¿tation, in Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to this purpoÅ¿e.</p>
            <p>
               <q>That King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had performed a moÅ¿t uÅ¿eful Office,
<note place="margin">A Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿trance of the ProteÅ¿tant Princes.</note> for the good of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tendom, by Å¿etling a Peace, in the Matters of Religion, between the Princes and the States of <hi>Germany:</hi> But then he had annexed a Limitation, which was very Grievous, That no ArchbiÅ¿hop, BiÅ¿hop, Abbat, or other EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿tical PerÅ¿on, Å¿hould receive the <hi>AuguÅ¿tane</hi> ConfeÅ¿Å¿ion, but that he Å¿hould reÅ¿ign his Office, and be deprived of the Revenues thereunto belonging. That thoÅ¿e of the <hi>AuguÅ¿tane</hi> ConfeÅ¿Å¿ion did not conÅ¿ent to this Limitation, nor can they now conÅ¿ent to it; becauÅ¿e this was a denying them the Benefit of imbracing the Sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and True Doctrin of the GoÅ¿pel, by which not only the BiÅ¿hops but their Subjects too, were driven out of the Kingdom of God, which was not fit to be done. BeÅ¿ides, it was a Reproach to their Religion, to Å¿uffer thoÅ¿e who Å¿hould imbrace the <hi>AuguÅ¿tane</hi> ConfeÅ¿Å¿ion, to be judged unworthy of the Sacred Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tery: And therefore they could not approve this ReÅ¿triction in the Dyet of <hi>Ausburg,</hi> without doing Injury to the Glory of God and their own ConÅ¿ciences; neither can they now conÅ¿ent to it. That this Limitation was an Hindrance to the Å¿o much deÅ¿ired Union of Religion, Å¿eeing thereby the BiÅ¿hops were deprived of the Liberty of Å¿peaking their Minds freely in Matters of Religion, becauÅ¿e they Å¿hould thereby forfeit their Office and Revenues, if they approved of the True Religion. That on the contrary, the Peace would be much Å¿tronger be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Princes and States of the Empire, if Religion were perfectly Free. That therefore the Electors, Princes and States, who had imbraced the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guÅ¿tane</hi> ConfeÅ¿Å¿ion, deÅ¿ired now (as they had alÅ¿o formerly done in the Dyet of <hi>Ausburg</hi>) That this grievous Limitation and ReÅ¿triction might be aboliÅ¿hed; and that it might be free for all EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿tical PerÅ¿ons to imbrace the <hi>AuguÅ¿tane</hi> ConfeÅ¿Å¿ion, and Å¿uffer their Subjects to imbrace it. That they of the <hi>AuguÅ¿tane</hi> ConfeÅ¿Å¿ion did not by this, deÅ¿ire that the Revenues of the Church Å¿hould be diÅ¿Å¿ipated, or turned to Profane UÅ¿es, or annexed to certain Families; but they would take great Care to prevent theÅ¿e Inconveniences, and do their utmoÅ¿t in it. And that by this means the true Intention of the Founders Å¿hould be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erved, tho' the ProfeÅ¿Å¿ion of the True Religion Å¿hould be permitted, for it was, without doubt, their DeÅ¿ign, to have the Pious and Sincere Service and WorÅ¿hip of God Promoted and Setled, tho' they err'd in their Choice. That the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, Princes and States, aforeÅ¿aid, would Å¿uffer the Publick and Civil BuÅ¿ineÅ¿s of the Empire to be diÅ¿patched in this Dyet at <hi>Ratisbonne;</hi> but then they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them, their Deputies, not to give any conÅ¿ent to any thing, till the Å¿aid Limitation were taken away: But then, if it was once AboliÅ¿hed and Repealed, they were ready and willing to aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t and promote the Publick Affairs in this Dyet, to the utmoÅ¿t of their Abilities.</q>

            <p>This ProteÅ¿tation or RemonÅ¿trance was very often renewed afterwards in Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of their Dyets; but being always oppoÅ¿ed by the Princes of the oppoÅ¿ite Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and by the Emperours, it could never be obtained; becauÅ¿e they ever thought, That the granting this Liberty, would end in the Rnine of the Roman Catholick Religion. On the other Å¿ide, thoÅ¿e of that Religion wrote Å¿harply
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51585:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>againÅ¿t the Peace of Religion, as it was then eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed by the Treaty of <hi>PaÅ¿Å¿aw,</hi> and the Dyet of <hi>AuÅ¿burg,</hi> calling it a <hi>LawleÅ¿s ConfuÅ¿ion;</hi> and in private, Å¿aying, <hi>That as it was obtained by a War, Å¿o it must by a War be revoked.</hi>

            <p>In the Year 1556, the Thirty firÅ¿t of <hi>July, Ignatius Loyola,</hi> the Founder of the Order of JeÅ¿uites, died, in the Sixty fifth year of his Age.

In the Year 1534 or 35 this Order was firÅ¿t framed by him; and in the Year 1609 he was Canonized by Pope <hi>Paul</hi> IV. And (as <hi>Petavius</hi> Å¿aith) it was confirm'd by <hi>Paul</hi> III, in 1540, the Twenty Å¿eventh of <hi>September.

            <p>Soon after the great ControverÅ¿ie between the Families of <hi>NaÅ¿Å¿aw</hi> and <hi>HeÅ¿Å¿e,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The County of <hi>Catzenello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bogen</hi> Å¿etled by Agreement.</note> which had been depending Fifty Years, and is often mention'd by <hi>Sleidan</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the County of <hi>Catzenellobogen</hi> was friendly ended at <hi>Frankfort</hi> upon the Main, by the InterpoÅ¿ition and Mediation of <hi>Otho Henry</hi> and <hi>AuguÅ¿tus</hi> Electors, <hi>William</hi> Duke of <hi>Cleves,</hi> and others, who were made Judges in this Affair for both Parties, the Landgrave of <hi>HeÅ¿Å¿e</hi> by their award retaining that County, upon paying to <hi>William</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> 1600 Crowns, and reÅ¿igning up to him the Earldom of <hi>Diez</hi> for 1050 Crowns.</p>
            <p>When the time of the Conference appointed by the Dyet drew near, the Divines who were of the <hi>AguÅ¿tane</hi> ConfeÅ¿Å¿ion, had a Meeting at <hi>Frankford</hi> on the Main, the FirÅ¿t of <hi>August,</hi> to adjuÅ¿t their own private Differences before they entred into a Conference with the <hi>Roman Catholicks;</hi>

               </note> Å¿o that this latter was not begun till the beginning of <hi>September.</hi> At the opening of it, <hi>Julius Pflug,</hi> BiÅ¿hop of <hi>Naumburg,</hi> who was PreÅ¿ident in this Conference, deÅ¿ired thoÅ¿e of the <hi>AuguÅ¿tane</hi> ConfeÅ¿Å¿ion, that they would in the firÅ¿t place Å¿hew openly their DiÅ¿agreement with, and DeteÅ¿tation of the <hi>Zuinglians, OÅ¿iandrians, SynergiÅ¿ts,</hi> and <hi>AdiaphoriÅ¿ts:</hi> BecauÅ¿e the Peace of Religion was only granted to thoÅ¿e of the <hi>AuguÅ¿tane</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿Å¿ion by the Dyet, and this Conference was appointed with none but them, and the Emperor beÅ¿ides knew that moÅ¿t of them had Orders to do this: That therefore Å¿ome benefit at leaÅ¿t might reÅ¿ult from this Conference, they would once for all, by a common conÅ¿ent, condemn theÅ¿e Errors, and there would be much leÅ¿s danger and difficulty in the reÅ¿t. The younger MiniÅ¿ters and Deputies of <hi>Saxony</hi> eaÅ¿ily aÅ¿Å¿ented, and producing their InÅ¿tructions, were very forward to Å¿eparate the <hi>AuguÅ¿tane</hi> ConfeÅ¿Å¿ion from theÅ¿e Errors. But <hi>Philip Melancthon</hi> (an old wiÅ¿e Man, who Å¿aw the drift of this cunning GameÅ¿ter) Å¿aid the Examination and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51585:8"/>Explication of their Å¿everal Doctrins ought to go before the Determination and Condemnation of them; and that till this was done, they ought not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. The <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> who were weary of the Conference, thereupon would go no further in it, till they had given an Account of this to the Emperor. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> commanded them to go on, and Å¿aid it was enough if in the ProgreÅ¿s of the Conference, when they had explained the Å¿everal Articles, they did at laÅ¿t remark what was diÅ¿allowed, by the common conÅ¿ent, in each of them. But the BiÅ¿hop of <hi>Naumburg</hi> refuÅ¿ing to go on, except he were firÅ¿t certain of the Faith of thoÅ¿e he was to diÅ¿pute with, the Conference broke up without effect, when there had only been Å¿ome Papers exchanged between them concerning the Rule of Judging ControverÅ¿ies and Original Sin.

            <p>Now the deÅ¿ign of this Condemnation was a DiviÅ¿ion of the <hi>ProteÅ¿tant</hi> IntereÅ¿t; that whereas they were too many for the <hi>Romau Catholicks</hi> while they were united, they might h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </note> The Truce being broken by the Attempt upon <hi>Doway,</hi> which I have mention'd already; the War went heavily on, becauÅ¿e the Flower of the Nobility and Gentry were gone with the Duke of <hi>GuiÅ¿e</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> which had much diÅ¿pirited and weakned <hi>France.</hi> And the Duke <hi>de Montmorancy,</hi> who from the beginning had a great AverÅ¿ion for this War, which he foreÅ¿aw would end in the Ruin of <hi>France,</hi> was more intent in levying Soldiers to defend the Borders of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> than in proÅ¿ecuting the War againÅ¿t King <hi>Philip,</hi> and Invading his Dominions.

            <p>The Spaniards were all this while intent in providing Men and Arms, and the Twenty fifth of <hi>July</hi> attack'd the Fort of <hi>Rocroy,</hi> in the Borders of <hi>Champagne</hi> and <hi>Hainalt,</hi> four Leagues from <hi>Maribourg</hi> to the South; but finding there a greater ReÅ¿iÅ¿tance than they expected, they marched away towards <hi>Picardy</hi> with an Army of Thirty five thouÅ¿and Foot, and Twelve thouÅ¿and HorÅ¿e. The Body of the French Army being but Eighteen thouÅ¿and Foot, and Five thouÅ¿and HorÅ¿e, and for the moÅ¿t part, both Sides Germans; Å¿o that the French thought it their IntereÅ¿t to coaÅ¿t along by the Enemy, and defend their Borders, and cover their Towns, which was all they could Å¿afely do in this inequality of Forces. There was then a very Å¿mall GarriÅ¿on in St. <hi>Quintin,</hi>

In the beginning of the Siege, <hi>Teligny</hi> was Å¿lain in a Sally, by Engaging imprudently beyond his Orders, who
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51585:8"/>was a PerÅ¿on of great Courage and Strength, InduÅ¿try and Fidelity, and an Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienc'd Commander. And <hi>Andelot,</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Montmorancy</hi> was from the beginning averÅ¿e to this War,

The Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi> and Å¿ome others of the principal French Commanders however eÅ¿caped.</p>
            <p>If the Victorious Army had forthwith marched to <hi>Paris,</hi> they might have taken it; but King <hi>Philip</hi> was reÅ¿olved to hazard nothing, but commanded his Army to go on with the Siege of St. <hi>Quintin;</hi> and the King of <hi>France</hi> leaving <hi>Compeigne,</hi> where he then was, and going to <hi>Paris,</hi> Å¿o quieted the Minds of the People by his PreÅ¿ence and good Words, that things began to Å¿ettle, and the fear in a Å¿hort time to abate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Coligny</hi> kept the TownÅ¿men of St. <hi>Quintin</hi> two days in Ignorance of this LoÅ¿s, and when they came to hear of it, though he Å¿aw the Town would at laÅ¿t be taken, yet he perÅ¿uaded them to hold it out to the laÅ¿t, that Å¿o the King might have time to recollect his Forces, and be in a condition to oppoÅ¿e the Victorious Enemy. Another of the <hi>Andelot's</hi> got into the Town, with about Five hundred ChoÅ¿en Men, and Å¿ome few Volunteers of the Nobility; but when all was done, King <hi>Philip</hi> coming in PerÅ¿on into the Camp, and the Siege being carried on with great dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, the Town was taken by Storm the 27th of <hi>August,</hi>

               <q>Though this Retreat gives me the utmoÅ¿t Å¿ecurity, yet I received the Account of your Victory with a joyful and a pleaÅ¿ed Mind; and I congratulate the happy and fortunate Beginnings of my beloved Sons Reign; and I render to God Almighty my humbleÅ¿t and devouteÅ¿t Thanks and PraiÅ¿es, who hath not Å¿uffer'd the PerÅ¿idy of his Enemies to go long unpuniÅ¿hed, but has thus Å¿uddenly chaÅ¿tiÅ¿ed the Truce-breakers both in <hi>Italy,</hi> and on the Borders of the <hi>Netherlands.</hi> For though my mind foretold me it would come Å¿o to paÅ¿s, and I comforted my Å¿elf with that hope, yet I was vex'd that juÅ¿t at that time, when I had reÅ¿tored ChriÅ¿tendom to her Peace, and was going to compoÅ¿e my Soul in Peace, all things Å¿hould of a Å¿udden be fill'd with an unexpected War and Tumult. But then as to the Advice my Son deÅ¿ires from me, he is not to expect it either now or hereafter. He has with him many grave and wiÅ¿e Men of an approved Fidelity, and bred up to BuÅ¿ineÅ¿s during my Reign, whoÅ¿e CounÅ¿el I would take if I were now at the Helm. Let him conÅ¿ult with theÅ¿e Men, and well conÅ¿idering the weight of their ReaÅ¿ons, after he has firÅ¿t implored the Divine AÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance and Grace, let him determine what is beÅ¿t to be done.</q>

He had been Å¿o long a Sovereign, that he knew the Thoughts and TenderneÅ¿s of a Princes Heart, and could diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h between Civility nnd reality. And which was moÅ¿t of all, he was really, and not pretendedly Dead to the World.</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Germans</hi> tumultuouÅ¿ly demanded their Pay, after the Victory; the <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> alÅ¿o deÅ¿ired leave to return, pretending they had been ill uÅ¿ed, and the King was forced to grant their RequeÅ¿t, to prevent worÅ¿e ConÅ¿equences; So that in a Å¿hort time this victorious Army moulder'd to nothing, tho' his Captains did what they could to perÅ¿uade him to keep his Army up. And, which was yet worÅ¿e, many of the <hi>Germans</hi> paÅ¿Å¿ed over to the <hi>French,</hi> and helped to fill up their Numbers; Å¿o that King Philip took only <hi>CaÅ¿telet, Han, Chaulnes</hi> and <hi>Noyon,</hi> all Å¿mall Places, and this laÅ¿t by Surprize too.

            <p>WhilÅ¿t the <hi>SpaniÅ¿h</hi> Army was thus mouldering away and diÅ¿perÅ¿ing, the <hi>French</hi> King was every Day increaÅ¿ing his.

The Women, and others, who were leÅ¿s able to Å¿hift, to the number of one hundred and twenty, rendred themÅ¿elves to <hi>Jean Martignon,</hi> the then <hi>Sheriff,</hi> who, when it was now Day, carried them to PriÅ¿on, the People being hardly kept from pulling them in Pieces, by the ConÅ¿tables and their Guards. Thereupon there were divers Rumors Å¿pread abroad concerning this Meeting, as is uÅ¿ual in New and Odious Occurrences:

               <hi>That this Rabble met in a Chamber in the Night, to Eat and play the Whore, and that after the Supper was over, they committed promiÅ¿cuous Villanies, the Mother lying with the Son, the Father with his Daughter, and the SiÅ¿ter with her Brother; That the Tables and ProviÅ¿ions were found, and that the Carpets and TapeÅ¿teries had Å¿till upon them the Marks of theÅ¿e Villanies: And becauÅ¿e this was not enough, they added, to enrage the Multitude yet more againÅ¿t them; that they had Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated in the Blood of a Child.</hi> This Account was given to the King, but without any Author to juÅ¿tifie it; but then no Man daring neither to contradict it, for fear of being taken for an Heretick; thoÅ¿e that were of the Religion, wrote a Å¿mall Piece, which they called an Apology, in which they Å¿hew, That the Crimes thus laid to their Charge were meer Slanders, and they cited PaÅ¿Å¿ages out of the Fathers of the Church, to Å¿hew that the Å¿ame Forgeries had been made uÅ¿e of by the Pagans againÅ¿t the Primitive ChriÅ¿tians; and that they might be Å¿ure it might come to the King's Hands, they got it conveyed into his Bed-chamber; which Book was afterwards anÅ¿wered by <hi>Anthony de Mouchy,</hi> a Divine, and the chief of the <hi>InquiÅ¿itors,</hi> and by <hi>Robert Cenali,</hi> BiÅ¿hop of <hi>Auranches.</hi>

This Town is Å¿eated in the Dukedom of <hi>Luxemburg,</hi> in a Plain Country, but Low and MarÅ¿hy, and having the <hi>MoÅ¿elle</hi> on the N.W. which fills its deep Ditches, on which Å¿ides it has only two BaÅ¿tions, which are Å¿hort, Å¿o that they cannot clear their Dikes, and at a great diÅ¿tance from each other. The reÅ¿t of the City is Å¿ecured by great Towers, which extend themÅ¿elves beyond the Walls, and they again are within well fill'd with Earth. <hi>Quaderebbe,</hi> a <hi>Brabentiner,</hi> was Governor of this Place, who had a GarriÅ¿on under him of One thouÅ¿and nine hundred Foot, and Two hundred HorÅ¿e.

Four thouÅ¿and TownÅ¿men, and Fifteen hundred Soldiers marched out of this place when it was yielded up, moÅ¿t of the latter being wounded on the Head. The French loÅ¿t Four hundred, and had more wounded in this Siege. After this, they took <hi>Arlone,</hi> another Town in the Å¿ame Dukedom, three German Miles from <hi>Luxemburg</hi> to the WeÅ¿t, by Surprize, which being burnt by an unexpected Accident, was diÅ¿mantled and deÅ¿erted.

This being known to <hi>Thermes,</hi> who expected the Duke of <hi>GuiÅ¿e</hi> every day according to his order, he recollected his Å¿cattered Forces; and although he was not well, took HorÅ¿e, and poÅ¿ted to his Camp near <hi>Graveling,</hi> being very Å¿olicitous, though too late, to Å¿ecure his Retreat to <hi>Calais,</hi> Count <hi>Egmont</hi> being now at his heels with his Forces: A Council of War was thereupon held in the Night, and it was reÅ¿olved that the French Å¿hould take the advantage of the Ebb the next Day, and march by the Sea-Å¿hore towards <hi>Calais.</hi> They paÅ¿Å¿ed the River <hi>Aa</hi> that Morning, without any difficulty at the Low-water; which <hi>Egmont</hi> obÅ¿erving, he paÅ¿Å¿ed it too, and met the French. <hi>Thermes,</hi> who Å¿aw now there was no Å¿ecurity but in their Valour, having the Sea to the North, the Dike of <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laie</hi> on his Back, and the Enemy on his Front and Side, thereupon drew up his Men in the order of Battel; being Å¿ecure on two Sides, to the South, which was his left-hand, he placed his Wagons, and planted his Field-pieces in the Front, which conÅ¿iÅ¿ted in Å¿ix Culverins and three Faulcons, and on his Wings he placed his HorÅ¿e, that they might cover the GaÅ¿coners who were in the Front, the other French were in the Middle, and the Germans in the Reer. Count <hi>Egmont</hi> had for haÅ¿te left all his Cannon on the other Å¿ide of the River, and would not Å¿tay for it, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the French might in the mean time eÅ¿cape him; dividing his HorÅ¿e into five Parts, he commanded the Light HorÅ¿e to begin the Fight; his Foot were divided into three Parts, according to their Nations, <hi>Flemings, Germans</hi> and <hi>Spaniards.</hi> He himÅ¿elf was one of the firÅ¿t that charged the <hi>GaÅ¿coners,</hi> who at firÅ¿t Å¿tood their ground Å¿toutly, and Count <hi>Egmont</hi>'s HorÅ¿e was Å¿lain under him; but his Army being moÅ¿t in number, when they came to cloÅ¿e Fight, HorÅ¿e to HorÅ¿e, and Foot to Foot, the <hi>Flemings</hi> being much encouraged by the hopes of Victory, and the <hi>French</hi> deÅ¿pairing of any other EÅ¿cape, the Fight was a long time doubtful; the <hi>GaÅ¿coners</hi> fought manfully, the <hi>Germans</hi> were only Spectators, and the <hi>French</hi> HorÅ¿e could do little for want of Ground; in the very heat of the Battel, twelve <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> Ships coming up, put an end to the Fight, by gauling the <hi>French</hi> on the Right Wing with their Canon on that Å¿ide they thought themÅ¿elves moÅ¿t Å¿ecure: Fifteen hundred were kill'd in the Fight, and many more periÅ¿hed in the Flight, being knock'd on the head by the PeaÅ¿ants, who were inraged by their Rapins; others were drown'd, and <hi>Thermes, Villebone, Senarpont,</hi> the Count of <hi>ChaulneÅ¿s</hi> and <hi>Merviliers</hi> were taken PriÅ¿oners; and the <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> Fleet took up Two hundred in the Sea, and carried them into <hi>England</hi> to the Queen.

            <p>The Duke of <hi>GuiÅ¿e</hi> hearing of this Defeat, return'd to <hi>Pierre-pont,</hi> in the Borders of <hi>Picardy</hi> and <hi>Champagne,</hi> the Twenty eighth of <hi>July,</hi> that he might be ready at hand to prevent any Attempt might be made on <hi>France.</hi> The TownÅ¿men meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as the CuÅ¿tom is, in a place call'd the <hi>Scholars Field,</hi> without the Suburbs of St. <hi>German,</hi> near <hi>Paris,</hi> a few of them, who were addicted to the <hi>ProteÅ¿tant</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, began to Å¿ing <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>PÅ¿alms</hi> in <hi>French</hi> Metre; thereupon the People began, to leave their Sports, and joyning with them, Å¿ung the Å¿ame PÅ¿alms: After this, a greater number, and among them <hi>Anthony</hi> King of <hi>Navarr,</hi> and <hi>Jonae</hi> his Lady, who was already Å¿uÅ¿pected to favour that Religion, fell into the Å¿ame Practice. The Clergy were much allarm'd at this, affirming that this new Invention was deÅ¿ign'd to bring the ancient CuÅ¿tom which they had received from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> their Mother, of Å¿inging the Publick Service in the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue, into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, by introducing the uÅ¿e of one underÅ¿tood by the meaneÅ¿t of the People. Whereupon they repreÅ¿ented this as very Seditious to the King, who order'd an Enquiry after the Authors of it to be made, and forbad the UÅ¿e of this CuÅ¿tom for the future, on pain of Death.</p>

The <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> entred the Town, and plundred it; but <hi>KerÅ¿imont</hi> the Governor of that Province, coming up with Six thouÅ¿and which he had haÅ¿tily raiÅ¿ed, he forced the <hi>EngliÅ¿h,</hi> with the loÅ¿s of Six hundred of their Men, to return on board their Ships; about an Hundrd of

            <p>The <hi>French</hi> by this time had got together a very great Army, which the King Å¿aw drawn up near <hi>Pierre-pont;</hi> and King <hi>Philip</hi>'s was not leÅ¿s, but then neither of theÅ¿e Princes were diÅ¿poÅ¿ed to try the Hazards of the War any further; and <hi>Montmoren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> having agreed for his RanÅ¿ome, at the rate of one hundred and Å¿ixty five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿and Crowns, and being now grown old, and averÅ¿e from the Thoughts of War, he and <hi>ChriÅ¿tierna,</hi> the Mother of the Duke of <hi>Loraine,</hi> went to and for between the two Princes, to promote a Treaty of Peace.</p>

The greateÅ¿t Difficulty they met with was about <hi>Calais,</hi> which the <hi>French</hi> were reÅ¿olved to keep, pretending it was an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Piece of their Dominions, tho'lately recovered: And the <hi>EngliÅ¿h,</hi> on the other Å¿ide, would never conÅ¿ent to the Treaty, if it were not reÅ¿tored: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this ConteÅ¿t could be brought to a concluÅ¿ion, <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>England</hi> dyed, which ended the ControverÅ¿ie for the preÅ¿ent, and thereupon this CongreÅ¿s was diÅ¿Å¿olved, and another Meeting appointed in the Å¿ame Place in <hi>January</hi> following.</p>
            <p>The fifth of <hi>November</hi> the <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> Parliament met,

On the Å¿eventeenth day of that Month, the Queen dyed, in the forty third Year of her Age, when Å¿he had reigned five Years four Months and eleven Days. Her Death was for Å¿ome Hours concealed, and then it was communicated to the HouÅ¿e of Lords by the Lord Chancellour, who Å¿ent for the HouÅ¿e of Commons, and the Lord Chancellour Å¿ignified to them alÅ¿o the Queen's Death; and both HouÅ¿es pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ently agreed to proclaim <hi>Elizabeth</hi> her SiÅ¿ter Queen, <hi>wiÅ¿hing her a long and a happy reign.</hi>

            <p>In <hi>Germany</hi> a Dyet was appointed to meet at <hi>Frankford</hi> the twenty fourth of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>German</hi> Affairs.</note> to which the AmbaÅ¿Å¿adours named by <hi>Charles</hi> V, before his Voyage into <hi>Spain,</hi> came and delivered his ReÅ¿ignation of the Empire, by which he had transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Authority to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> his Brother, then King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> to the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, who after a Å¿hort deliberation accepted the Å¿ame, and in a Å¿olemn manner elected and admitted <hi>Ferdinand</hi> to the Empire, and afterwards crowned him.

The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roÅ¿e Old Gentleman would not admit the AmbaÅ¿Å¿adour, but left the buÅ¿ineÅ¿s to be diÅ¿cuÅ¿Å¿ed by the Cardinals, who were appointed for that purpoÅ¿e; who muÅ¿t needs make a great buÅ¿ineÅ¿s of it, and reÅ¿olved, <hi>That what had been done at</hi> Frankford <hi>was of no Validity, becauÅ¿e the Holy See had not conÅ¿ented to it, and ChriÅ¿t's Vicar, who was entruÅ¿ted with the Keys of the

That no ReÅ¿ignation or Deprivation could be made to or by any other than the Pope. BeÅ¿ides what was done at</hi> Frankford, <hi>had been tranÅ¿acted by Men infected with HereÅ¿ie, who had loÅ¿t all that Grace and Power, which belonged to them, whilÅ¿t they were Members of the Church of</hi> Rome: <hi>That therefore</hi> Ferdinand <hi>was to appear within three Months before the Pope's Tribunal, to anÅ¿wer for his MiÅ¿demeanours, and to Å¿hew his Repentance; and then without doubt he would obtain Pardon from this meek Father:</hi> With much more to the Å¿ame purpoÅ¿e.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ferdinand</hi> was of another Temper, and ordered his AmbaÅ¿Å¿adour to return, if he were not admitted within three Days, leaving a ProteÅ¿tation behind him. This a little quelled the Pope, who admitted him to a Private Audience the thirteenth of

               <hi>July,</hi> when the Pope <hi>excuÅ¿ed himÅ¿elf for not having granted his RequeÅ¿t Å¿ooner, for want of LeiÅ¿ure and Time to examine all the Difficulties which were propoÅ¿ed in this Affair by the Cardinals; and Å¿eeing his LordÅ¿hip could Å¿tay no longer at</hi> Rome, <hi>he might return when he pleaÅ¿ed, and he would Å¿end an AmbaÅ¿Å¿adour to the Emperour</hi> (Å¿o he called <hi>Charles</hi> V, notwithÅ¿tanding his ReÅ¿ignation) <hi>as Å¿oon as was poÅ¿Å¿ible.</hi> And thus this thing Å¿tood till the Death of Pope <hi>Paul</hi> III.</p>

               <hi>Thuanus</hi> Å¿aith of him, That no part of his Life was deÅ¿titute of Å¿ome commendable Action, yet he Å¿hew'd the greatneÅ¿s of his Soul moÅ¿t viÅ¿ibly in the cloÅ¿e of it: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was wont to conquer others, in this he overcame himÅ¿elf, and reflecting on a better Life, renounced this preÅ¿ent, which was lyable to Å¿o many Chances, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he dyed; and having Å¿o many Years lived to the good of others, began now to live only to God and himÅ¿elf. In all that two Years which went next before his DiÅ¿Å¿olution, he lived in the Society of Å¿ome Monks of the Order of S. <hi>Jerome;</hi> and by the Advice of one <hi>ConÅ¿tantin,</hi> his ConfeÅ¿Å¿or, applied himÅ¿elf chiefly to the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> and fixing his Soul only on God, thus he argued:
<note place="margin">His Opinion concerning JuÅ¿tification.</note> That he was unworthy, by his own Merits, to obtain the Kingdom of Heaven; but his Lord God, who had a double Right to it, that of Inheritance from his Father, and that of the Merits of his PaÅ¿Å¿ion, was content with the firÅ¿t as to himÅ¿elf, and has left the Å¿econd to me, by whoÅ¿e Gift I may juÅ¿tly claim it, and truÅ¿ting to this Faith, I Å¿hall not be aÅ¿hamed: For neither can the Oyl of Mercy be put in any other VeÅ¿Å¿el than that of Faith: That this is the only Confidence of that Man who forÅ¿akes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf and relies upon his Lord: That to truÅ¿t any otherwiÅ¿e to ones own Merits was not of Faith but Perfidy: That Sins were forgiven by the Mercy of God, and therefore we ought to believe that none but God can blot them out, againÅ¿t whom only we have Å¿inned, in whom is no Å¿in, and by whom alone our Å¿ins are forgiven, us. TheÅ¿e Doctrins were afterwards thought in <hi>Spain</hi> to approach Å¿o near thoÅ¿e of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> that his ConfeÅ¿Å¿or was burnt for an Heretick after he was dead; and Å¿ome others that were about him had hard meaÅ¿ure, after his Death, on that account, and <hi>Lucas OÅ¿iander</hi> affirms, in expreÅ¿s Terms, That <hi>Charles</hi> V, dyed a <hi>Lutheran</hi> in the Point of JuÅ¿tification.</p>

The Clergy Å¿eeing their Authority thus Å¿inking, aÅ¿Å¿embled in a Synod, the ninth of <hi>November,</hi> to try if the Å¿eting a good Face, and pretending great ConÅ¿idence would retrieve their Å¿inking CauÅ¿e: But they of the Reformed Party, on the contrary, of all Degrees exhorted one another to perÅ¿evere in the Truth, <hi>and not to Å¿uffer themÅ¿elves to be oppreÅ¿Å¿ed by a Å¿mall and weak number of Men: For if</hi> (Å¿ay they) <hi>theÅ¿e Men proceed by Legal CourÅ¿es, we Å¿hall be too hard for them, if they make uÅ¿e of Force, we are a Match for them.</hi> They drew up an AddreÅ¿s alÅ¿o to the Queen Regent, which they Å¿ent unto her by one <hi>James Sandelands,</hi> an Honourable Baron, and of great account, in it deÅ¿iring, That the Publick Prayers and AdminiÅ¿tration of the Sacraments might be in the Vulgar Tongue, and that the MiniÅ¿ters might be elected by the People. The Regent, tho' a zealous Catholick, yet fearing a Tumult, commanded the PrieÅ¿ts to Å¿ay the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the <hi>Scotch</hi> Language. The Å¿ame Demands were made by the Nobility of the Synod, then aÅ¿Å¿embled at <hi>Edinburgh:</hi> Who replyed, That they muÅ¿t abide by the Orders of the Canon-Law, and the Decrees of the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> The No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility perceiving them thus averÅ¿e to a Reformation, Å¿ent one <hi>John Aresken</hi> of <hi>Dundee</hi> a learned Man to appeaÅ¿e them; who with great reÅ¿pect beÅ¿ought them, At leaÅ¿t to grant the People the uÅ¿e of the publick Prayers in their Mother Tongue. The Clergy would nevertheleÅ¿s abate nothing of their former Severity; and the Queen regent, by their PerÅ¿uaÅ¿ion Å¿oon recalled what had been extorted from her. But the Death of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and the SucceÅ¿Å¿ion of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> which happened this Month, Å¿oon turned the Scales, and gave her CauÅ¿e to repent her too great obÅ¿tinacy.</p>
            <p>The Learned <hi>SpotiÅ¿wood</hi> obÅ¿erves, That this <hi>Mills</hi> was the laÅ¿t Martyr that dyed in <hi>Scotland</hi> for Religion; That <hi>Patrick Lermoth</hi> Bailiff of the Regality, abÅ¿olutely refuÅ¿ed to paÅ¿s Sentence of Death, as a Judge upon him, after the BiÅ¿hop had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered him up to the Secular Power; that in the whole City of S. <hi>Andrews</hi> a Cord was not to be had for Money, Å¿o that they were forced to take one of the Cords of the ArchbiÅ¿hop's Pavilion, to tie him to the Stake. It had been good Prudence to have deÅ¿iÅ¿ted, when they Å¿aw the whole Body of the People thus bent againÅ¿t them, but they were hurried on to their Ruine, by a blind Rage.</p>
            <p>The People of <hi>Scotland</hi> were no leÅ¿s incenÅ¿ed on the other Side, and reÅ¿olved openly to profeÅ¿s the Reformed Religion, binding themÅ¿elves by PromiÅ¿e and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cription to an Oath, That <hi>if any Å¿hould be called in queÅ¿tion for matters of Religion, at any time hereafter, they would take Arms, and joyn in defence of their Religion and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, againÅ¿t the Tyranny and PerÅ¿ecution of the BiÅ¿hops.</hi> The principal Men, who joyned in this Bond were <hi>Archibald</hi> Earl of <hi>Argile, Alexander</hi> Earl of <hi>Glencarne, James</hi> Earl of <hi>Morton, Archibald</hi> Lord of <hi>Lorne,</hi> Sir <hi>James Sandelands</hi> of <hi>Calder, John Erskin</hi> of <hi>Dun,</hi> and <hi>William Maitland</hi> of <hi>Lethington.</hi> To this Bond vaÅ¿t num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers throughout the Kingdom Å¿ubÅ¿cribed, Å¿o that they found their numbers were at leaÅ¿t equal to thoÅ¿e that oppoÅ¿ed them.</p>

               <note place="margin">The Affairs of <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </note> The Kindred of the Pope had already made themÅ¿elves hated by all ChriÅ¿tendom, and now the Pope himÅ¿elf too fell out with them. they had engaged the Pope in the War with <hi>Spain,</hi> which had brought Å¿o much LoÅ¿s and Shame upon that See, and its Dominions. In the time of thoÅ¿e ConfuÅ¿ions they had acted many things with great Rapacity, Intemperance and InÅ¿olence without the Pope's knowledge, who finding his TreaÅ¿ure exhauÅ¿ted, had by their Advice raiÅ¿ed great and extraordinary Taxes upon his People; and beÅ¿ides all this, had Å¿old the Places of the Criminal and Civil Judges, Å¿uppreÅ¿Å¿ed the monthly Payments of his Officers, and Å¿eized many of the Lands belonging to the Religious Orders, and had levied two Tenths upon all the Benefices. The War with King <hi>Philip</hi> being ended, and the Pope having with a calm and diÅ¿paÅ¿Å¿ionate mind heard the Complaints made againÅ¿t his Relations by one <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> a Fryer of the <hi>Theatin</hi> Order, and eÅ¿pecially againÅ¿t the Cardinal of <hi>Caraffa,</hi> began more nearly to inÅ¿pect his own Affairs, and the Lives of his Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. About the Å¿ame time, <hi>CoÅ¿mus</hi> Duke of <hi>Florenee</hi> made great Complaint alÅ¿o of the <hi>Caraffa</hi>'s, becauÅ¿e not content with the extorting what they pleas'd from the HoÅ¿pitals, MonaÅ¿teries and Clergy within the Pope's Dominions (which they lookt upon as their own) they had alÅ¿o by their private Authority done the Å¿ame Wrongs in the Dukedom of <hi>Florence,</hi> and indeed all over <hi>Italy.</hi> He thereupon order'd <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gianni Gianfigliacci,</hi> his ReÅ¿ident at <hi>Rome,</hi> to complain of this to the Pope; but then the <hi>Caraffa</hi>'s had prevented him from having any Audience; whereupon <hi>CoÅ¿mus</hi> wrote a Letter to the Pope, which was by the means of Cardinal <hi>Vitelli,</hi> an Hater of their InÅ¿olence, deliver'd to the Pope. He having read it, Å¿ent preÅ¿ently for his old Monitor <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and by him ordered <hi>Vitelli</hi> to give him a more exact account of their MiÅ¿demeanors. There was nothing more incenÅ¿ed the Pope againÅ¿t them (who was Imperious and Jealous of his Papal Power to the utmoÅ¿t degree) than that the Cardinal had agreed, without his knowledge or conÅ¿ent, with the Duke <hi>de Alva;</hi> that his Brother Å¿hould accept of a CompenÅ¿ation from King <hi>Philip</hi> inÅ¿tead of <hi>Paliani,</hi> which Place the Pope had deÅ¿igned to unite to his See. Whereupon he preÅ¿ently commanded the Cardinal to leave the <hi>Vatican,</hi> and not to come any more into his PreÅ¿ence. The Twenty Å¿eventh of <hi>January</hi> the Pope Å¿ummon'd a great ConÅ¿iÅ¿tory, and in it diÅ¿charged him of the Prime MiniÅ¿try of Affairs, and of the Government of <hi>Bononia.</hi> He took alÅ¿o from the Duke of <hi>Paliani,</hi> his Brother, the Command of the Forces of the EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿tick State, and of the Gallies, and deprived the MarqueÅ¿s <hi>di Monte Belli</hi> of the CuÅ¿tody of the Vatican Palace, declaring againÅ¿t them with that fury, that Å¿ome of the Cardinals attempted to appeaÅ¿e him, and among them <hi>Ranutio</hi> Cardinal of <hi>FarneÅ¿s:</hi> To whom he replied, <hi>That your Grandfather had done much better, if like me he had Å¿acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed his private Affections to his PaÅ¿toral Office, and having Å¿everely chaÅ¿tiÅ¿ed your Father's
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51585:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>abominable LuÅ¿ts and Villanies, had thereby prevented the Å¿candal the Impunity of them hath given to the whole World.</hi> So that nothing that could be Å¿aid or done, could reduce the old Man from his ReÅ¿olves againÅ¿t them, but tended rather to the encreaÅ¿ing of his Fury. And hereupon he forthwith aboliÅ¿h'd Å¿ome ImpoÅ¿ts, pretending they were exacted without his knowledge: By all which he hoped to obtain the repute of a JuÅ¿t and Upright Prince, and to caÅ¿t the Odium of the ill things which had been done in his Popedom, upon his Relations. After this, he betook himÅ¿elf wholly to the promoting the <hi>InquiÅ¿ition,</hi> which he call'd the moÅ¿t <hi>Holy Tribunal,</hi> and here he Å¿hewed a very great Å¿everity, bringing not only Men Å¿uÅ¿pected of HereÅ¿ie, but of Å¿ome other Crimes within their JuriÅ¿diction. Then commanding all Monks and Nuns to their Å¿everal HouÅ¿es, he ImpriÅ¿on'd Å¿ome, and Å¿ent others to the Gallies, for not preÅ¿ently obeying him. His Rigour was Å¿o great in this laÅ¿t, that many left his State, and went and Å¿etled in the State of <hi>Venice.</hi> He Å¿pent Fifty thouÅ¿and Crowns in Corn, to relieve the Poor in a time of Scarcity, and Å¿etled BiÅ¿hops at <hi>Malacha</hi> and <hi>Cochin,</hi> two Cities belonging to the <hi>PortugueÅ¿e</hi> in the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> and made the BiÅ¿hop of <hi>Goa</hi> an ArchbiÅ¿hop, exempting him from the JuriÅ¿diction of the BiÅ¿hoprick of <hi>LiÅ¿bon.</hi> He alÅ¿o erected many new Sees in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> at the requeÅ¿t of <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> to the Diminution of the JuriÅ¿diction and DioceÅ¿Å¿es of many <hi>French</hi> and <hi>German</hi> BiÅ¿hops. TheÅ¿e Sees were Å¿etled at <hi>Mechlen, Antwerp, Harlem, Daventrie, Leewarden, Groningen, Midleburg, BoÅ¿leduc,
<note place="margin">New BiÅ¿hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks erected in the <hi>Low-Countries.</hi>
                  </note> Namur,</hi> St. <hi>Omers, IpreÅ¿s, Gant</hi> and <hi>Bruges,</hi> and were put under the ArchbiÅ¿hops of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray, Mechlin</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Æ²</g>trecht.</hi> This change gave great offence to the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> who eÅ¿teem'd itrather an InÅ¿laving than an Honouring of their Country, to have Å¿o many New Sees Å¿etled among them; and the more, becauÅ¿e among other ReaÅ¿ons aÅ¿Å¿igned by the Pope, one was, That theÅ¿e Countries were on all Å¿ides encompaÅ¿s'd with Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which had caÅ¿t off the See of <hi>Rome;</hi> Å¿o that the Salvation of the Souls of this People was much endanger'd by SchiÅ¿m, which rendred this Settlement hateful to all thoÅ¿e who favour'd the Reformation; Å¿o that this was one of the principal CauÅ¿es of the War which followed, which in the end proved fatal to many of theÅ¿e New BiÅ¿hopricks.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>interim,</hi> this ConÅ¿ideration had that effect upon the Spirit of King <hi>Philip,</hi>
               <note place="margin">King <hi>Philip</hi> deÅ¿irous of a Peace with <hi>France,</hi> that he might be at leiÅ¿ure to extirpate He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reÅ¿ie.</note> that it greatly diÅ¿poÅ¿ed him above all others to enter into a Treaty of Peace with <hi>France.</hi> He Å¿aw that not only the Licence which attended a War, but the vaÅ¿t number of <hi>Germans</hi> which he was forced to employ, by their converÅ¿ing with his Subjects in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> begat in them a good Opinion of <hi>Luther</hi> and the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. <hi>Henry</hi> II of <hi>France</hi> imprudently communicated to <hi>William</hi> of <hi>NaÅ¿Å¿aw,</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> when he was EmbaÅ¿Å¿ador for <hi>Philip</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> when they were one day Hunting together,

Nor was indeed his IntereÅ¿t in the ReÅ¿titution Å¿o great as that of the <hi>French</hi> was to keep them, he having very effectually provided for his own Security and Benefit, by the gaining other Places.</p>

               </note> who deÅ¿paired of reconciling the differences of Religion on theÅ¿e Terms, and having no other way left him for preÅ¿erving the Peace of <hi>Germany,</hi> Confirm'd the Peace of <hi>PaÅ¿Å¿aw.</hi> After this, they took into ConÅ¿ideration the Reduction of the Monies of <hi>Germany</hi> to their ancient value and purity, and heard the Complaints of <hi>William</hi> of <hi>FurÅ¿temberg,</hi> Great MaÅ¿ter of the Knights of <hi>Livonia,</hi> who obtain'd a Grant of an Hundred thouÅ¿and Crowns for the Levying of an Army for their Protection againÅ¿t the <hi>RuÅ¿s:</hi> But this Sum Å¿eeming leÅ¿s than the neceÅ¿Å¿ity of their Affairs and of the Times required, the <hi>Livonians</hi> neglected it, and betook themÅ¿elves to the Protection of <hi>SigiÅ¿mund AuguÅ¿tus,</hi> King of <hi>Poland,</hi> to whom they aÅ¿Å¿ign'd Nine of their Å¿trongeÅ¿t Places, upon condition that they might at any time redeem them by the payment of Six thouÅ¿and Crowns, which was confirm'd by a Treaty Signed and Sworn between them and the King of <hi>Poland.</hi> After which, <hi>FurÅ¿temberg</hi> reÅ¿igned his Dignity to <hi>Gotard Ketler.</hi> There was alÅ¿o a Complaint made by the <hi>Livonians</hi> againÅ¿t the Inhabitants of <hi>Lubeck, Riga</hi> and <hi>Revel,</hi> for furniÅ¿hing the <hi>RuÅ¿s,</hi> who were the Enemies of <hi>Germany,</hi> not only with all Å¿orts of Merchandize imported by them to <hi>Narva,</hi> a Town of <hi>RuÅ¿Å¿ia,</hi> but alÅ¿o with Arms and Ammunition, which for the future, was, by a Law made in this Dyet, forbidden, which was afterwards repeal'd.</p>
            <p>The Twenty eighth of <hi>March,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>French</hi> EmbaÅ¿Å¿adors come to the Dyet.</note> the <hi>French</hi> EmbaÅ¿Å¿adors were introduced into the Dyet, and after they had in an Elegant Speech declared the great Affections their MaÅ¿ter had for the Emperor and the States of <hi>Germany;</hi> they deÅ¿ired the ancient League might be renewed between the Empire and that Kingdom; and that for the future there might be a firmer and cloÅ¿er Union and FriendÅ¿hip. Upon this the Emperor returned Thanks to the EmbaÅ¿Å¿adors, Å¿aying, That the King might be aÅ¿Å¿ured of the FriendÅ¿hip of the Empire, the Princes and States, and of his too, if his Actions did agree with his Words, and thoÅ¿e Cities which had lately been taken from the Empire, were reÅ¿tored to it: That this being done, he did not Å¿ee what could hinder their entring into a Å¿incere FriendÅ¿hip. At this the EmbaÅ¿Å¿adors replied, That they had no InÅ¿truction concerning what he had propoÅ¿ed about the Cities, but they would given an Account of it to the King their MaÅ¿ter, and in the mean time they deÅ¿ired the States would meet the King's PropoÅ¿als of FriendÅ¿hip with equal Candour. Upon this the AÅ¿Å¿embly broke up, and the EmbaÅ¿Å¿adors were re-conducted back with great Civility and ReÅ¿pect; to whom it was hinted, that the Emperor could not but mention the ReÅ¿titution of the Cities, but then that neither he, the Princes, nor the States would break with the King of <hi>France,</hi> though thoÅ¿e Cities were not reÅ¿tored. They decreed alÅ¿o a Noble EmbaÅ¿Å¿y to the King of <hi>France,</hi> in which the Cardinal of <hi>AuÅ¿burg</hi> and <hi>ChriÅ¿topher</hi> Duke of <hi>Wirtemburg</hi> were employed.</p>
            <p>One <hi>David George,</hi> a Native of <hi>Delft</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> born of mean Parents, his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being a Fencer, and his Mother a mean Woman, and himÅ¿elf unacquainted with
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51585:15"/>any other than his Mother-Tongue; was a PerÅ¿on of great Å¿eeming Moderation, Å¿o that all took him for a very HoneÅ¿t and well-meaning Man, tho' he was of a Å¿tubborn and incorrigable diÅ¿poÅ¿ition.
<note place="margin">The Life and Death of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid George,</hi> a famous Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿tor.</note> He was a PerÅ¿on of a comely Countenance-and good meine, and all the Motions of his Body were Grave and becoming, Å¿o that he Å¿eem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed made up of HoneÅ¿ty. This Man Å¿pread amongÅ¿t his Country-men the PeÅ¿tilent Sect of AnabaptiÅ¿ts, to which they were very much diÅ¿poÅ¿ed, and this being done to his great advantage (for he had got a good EÅ¿tate by it) and fearing he might not be Å¿afe, if he continued any longer in his Native Country, where he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the Head of that Sect, he went with Å¿ome of his Followers to <hi>BaÅ¿il,</hi> in the Year 1544, under the Name of <hi>John Bruck,</hi> and the firÅ¿t of <hi>April</hi> made a Speech in the Senate of that City; deÅ¿iring, He might be protected by them, as one forced to flee for his Religion; and that they would receive his Wife, Children, Family and Fortunes, as in a Å¿afe Harbour. The CauÅ¿e, the PerÅ¿on, and the Speech, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Å¿o exactly, and his Temper was Å¿o wholely unknown to them, as well as his former Life, and his Country being very remote, what he Å¿aid appeared Å¿o like Truth, and had happened to Å¿o many others, That <hi>AuguÅ¿t</hi> 25, having given the uÅ¿ual Oath, he was taken into the Protection of that City; where he lived with the ReÅ¿pect to the MagiÅ¿trate, that Humanity towards the Citizens, and that Civility towards all, obÅ¿erving carefully their Religious Rites, and in all things behaved himÅ¿elf Å¿o well, that he gave not the leaÅ¿t occaÅ¿ion to any to Å¿uÅ¿pect him of any erroneous Doctrin, and he was as well thought of by the moÅ¿t, as he DeÅ¿ired to be, or was eÅ¿teemed by his own Party. Thus he lived very quietly in his Family, obÅ¿erving very Å¿trictly three things: 1. Concealing the Name of <hi>David George,</hi> by which he was well known in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>FrieÅ¿land.</hi> 2. Of what State and Condition he was at Home; Å¿o that Å¿ome took him for a PerÅ¿on of good Birth, others for a Nobleman or Rich Merchant. 3. LaÅ¿tly, he took Care not to admit any into his Sect of the City of <hi>BaÅ¿il,</hi> or of the neighbouring Country: But, in the mean time, he took care by Letters, Books and MeÅ¿Å¿engers, to enlarge his Sect in <hi>Holland,</hi> and in other Å¿uch diÅ¿tant Places: But as to <hi>Switzerland</hi> he medled not, for fear he might be diÅ¿covered. Having thus Å¿pent Å¿ix Years, with great PleaÅ¿ure, there happened a thing which gave him Å¿ome DiÅ¿turbance, one of his Followers falling off, upon better Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and appearing with great Zeal againÅ¿t the Doctrins of his <hi>quondam</hi> MaÅ¿ter: His HouÅ¿e being alÅ¿o burnt with Lightning, was a Å¿ad PreÅ¿age, That his good Fortune and his Life were near their End. But that which moÅ¿t afflicted him, was, That an able PerÅ¿on was come from <hi>Holland,</hi> who had given an exact account of him and his Family, to the Citizens of <hi>BaÅ¿il;</hi> this brought a great DeÅ¿pondence of Mind upon him, and that a SickneÅ¿s, which Å¿eized his Wife alÅ¿o, who dyed firÅ¿t, and <hi>David George</hi> followed her himÅ¿elf <hi>AuguÅ¿t</hi> 25, 1556; and he was buried with great Pomp, in the Church of S. <hi>Leonard.</hi> Thus died that famous ImpoÅ¿tor and Deceiver, who had pretended, That he was greater, and more Divine than ChriÅ¿t, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal; that the Doctrin of <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> and the Prophets, ChriÅ¿t and the ApoÅ¿tles, was imperfect, and did not lead to a true and perfect Felicity; but his was Å¿uch as would certainly make him, who rightly underÅ¿tood it, happy: That he was the true <hi>ChriÅ¿t</hi> and <hi>MeÅ¿Å¿iah,</hi> the moÅ¿t beloved Son of the Father, who was begotten not of FleÅ¿h but by the Holy GhoÅ¿t, and the Spirit of ChriÅ¿t; which having reduced his FleÅ¿h to nothing, and kept it in a certain place, unknown to the Saints, had at laÅ¿t deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered it to <hi>David George;</hi> with much more Å¿uch BlaÅ¿phemous NonÅ¿enÅ¿e. After his Death, the Frand broke out, and this Year <hi>March</hi> 12, his Sons, and all that belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, to the number of eleven, were brought before the Senate, and examined concerning his Name, Country and Doctrin: And they anÅ¿wering as he had taught, were committed to different PriÅ¿ons, and all his Papers and Writings were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the Divines. <hi>April</hi> 26, the Divines and UniverÅ¿ity having conÅ¿idered them, condemn'd his Doctrin as falÅ¿e, contrary to the Å¿acred Scriptures, pernicious and injurious to JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, and to be exterminated out of the ChriÅ¿tian World. After this, his Sons were diÅ¿miÅ¿s'd out of PriÅ¿on, upon condition they Å¿hould buy no Lands without the Walls of the City, without the PermiÅ¿Å¿ion of the Senate: That they Å¿hould entertain no Travellers, though of their near Relations, but Å¿hould Å¿end them to the publick Inns: That they Å¿hould deliver in all the Books written or printed by <hi>David George,</hi> and not keep any by them in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Tongue; and that they Å¿hould Å¿end their Children to the School of <hi>BaÅ¿il</hi> to be inÅ¿tructed: That they Å¿hould pay a Pecuniary Mulct, if required; and that they, their Wives and Children Å¿hould appear in the Church, and make ProfeÅ¿Å¿ion of the True Faith, and Renounce that of <hi>David George.</hi> Two days after, his Body was Å¿entenc'd to be
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51585:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>taken up and burnt, together with his Books and Effigies, by the Hands of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Hang-man, in the place where they uÅ¿ally executed Malefactors; and all his Goods they Å¿eiz'd to the Publick TreaÅ¿ure; adding, That if any PerÅ¿on preÅ¿um'd to blame this their Decree, he Å¿hould be liable to the Å¿ame PuniÅ¿hment. His Body was found very perfect, Å¿o that it might be known by his yellow Beard from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man's, though he had been buried two Years and Å¿ix Months, and was accordingly burnt in a vaÅ¿t concourÅ¿e of Men.</p>

This laÅ¿t ClauÅ¿e, by the perverÅ¿e CounÅ¿els of theÅ¿e Princes, in a Å¿hort time raiÅ¿ed a War in the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> which was more laÅ¿ting and more fatal than any former Wars. This Treaty was Å¿igned at <hi>Cambray, April</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>TheÅ¿e two Kings having thus regained their Peace,

               </note> and disburthened themÅ¿elves of the Cares which the War brought upon them, they betook themÅ¿elves Å¿olely to the Care of Religion, which in <hi>France</hi> had been under conÅ¿ideration the two forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Years, and was then omitted on account of the War and Treaty, but was now reaÅ¿Å¿umed in the heat of a Marriage-FeaÅ¿t. There was one <hi>Diana</hi> DutcheÅ¿s of <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinois,</hi> a Court-Lady, and one of the King's MiÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿es, who uÅ¿ed to beg the EÅ¿tates of all Å¿uch as Å¿uffered for any Crime; And the Duke of <hi>GuiÅ¿e,</hi> who were the Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this PerÅ¿ecution, the latter aiming at nothing but Popular ApplauÅ¿e: TheÅ¿e two inÅ¿inuated this Belief into the King; That <hi>the Venome of HereÅ¿ie was much Å¿pread in</hi> France, <hi>and that in truth he was not King of thoÅ¿e Provinces in which that prevailed: That the Impudence of thoÅ¿e who imbraced it, was Å¿o great, that they did not whiÅ¿per it, as heretofore, in the Ear, but preached it openly and boldly throughout the Kingdom, by which the name of God was blaÅ¿phemed, and his MajeÅ¿ties Royal Authority was endangered; for when the Law of God was once confounded, who can QueÅ¿tion,</hi> (Å¿ay they) <hi>but that all Human Laws will Å¿oon be Å¿ubverted?</hi> And that they might the more eaÅ¿ily prevail, they employed <hi>Giles MaiÅ¿tre,</hi> preÅ¿ident of the Parliament, <hi>Jean de S. Andre, Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Minart,</hi> and <hi>Giles Bourdin</hi> the King's Attorney, and principally the firÅ¿t of theÅ¿e, who was a Man of a fierce DiÅ¿poÅ¿ition and Temper, to incenÅ¿e the King's Mind againÅ¿t the Sectaries, he being no way inclined to Å¿uch Severities. To this end they tell him, <hi>That there would little be gained by the Peace, if a more cruel War was fomented and carried on at Home: For that the DiÅ¿eaÅ¿e had already got Å¿uch Strength, that if his MajeÅ¿ty diÅ¿Å¿embled a little longer, the Sword of the MagiÅ¿trate and the Laws of the Land would not be able to Å¿uppreÅ¿s it, but he muÅ¿t levy Armies, and himÅ¿elf take the Field againÅ¿t them, as had been done in the caÅ¿e of the</hi> AlbingenÅ¿es. <hi>That what had hitherto been done, had not had its deÅ¿ired effect, becauÅ¿e all the Å¿everity had been Å¿pent upon the populace and the mean people, the hatred and deteÅ¿tation of which had affected all Men, but very few had taken example by it. That now it was fit to begin with the Judges, many of which had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced their Doctrin Å¿ecretly, or favoured them on other accounts, and by their connivance nouriÅ¿hed the DiÅ¿temper, Å¿uffering this Offence either to go unpuniÅ¿hed, or very lightly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected. This, they Å¿aid, was the very Root of the Evil, and that all labour was in vain till it were pulled up.</hi>

            <p>Not long after this, the King was prevailed
<note n="*" place="margin">The King goes to the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> to aw it into a Compliance.</note> upon to come into the Parliament in PerÅ¿on, whilÅ¿t the Members were debating about the PuniÅ¿hment of the Sectaries, <hi>June</hi> 14. He-Å¿eemed rather to labour to conceal his Anger, than to have come with a calm Mind: Among other things he told the Parliament; That <hi>having made a Peace he hoped it would turn to the general Good; but he was much concerned that the buÅ¿ineÅ¿s of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which was one of the principal Cares of a good Prince, had been, during the War, tumultuouÅ¿ly and Å¿editiouÅ¿ly treated by Å¿ome: That therefore he deÅ¿ired for the future, more care might be taken of the ChriÅ¿tian Religion: And becauÅ¿e he heard that affair was this Day to be debated by them, he was come thither; and he admoniÅ¿hed them to proceed in it with Freedom, Å¿aying, It was God's CauÅ¿e, who knew all our Hearts and Thoughts.</hi>

            <pb n="31" facs="tcp:51585:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>Tho' the Members of the Parliament knew the King was brought thither to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive them of their Liberty;
<note place="margin">Yet Å¿ome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained their Freedom at the Price of their Lives.</note> yet there were Å¿ome who reÅ¿olved to retain their ancient Freedom at the price of their Lives; and having declaimed againÅ¿t the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> and its ill CuÅ¿tomes, which had degenerated into moÅ¿t pernicious Errors, and given occaÅ¿ion to the riÅ¿e of many Sects; they thence infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, That the Penalties of HereÅ¿ie were to be mitigated, and the Severities of the Law abated, till the differences of Religion were compoÅ¿ed by the Authority of a General Council, and the DiÅ¿cipline of the Church reformed. And this was the Opinion of all the good Men in the Parliament. <hi>Arnold du Ferrier,</hi> PreÅ¿ident of the Criminal Court, an honeÅ¿t and a wiÅ¿e PerÅ¿on, and the beÅ¿t Lawyer in <hi>France,</hi> was the firÅ¿t who propoÅ¿ed this Method, and was followed by many others, among which was <hi>Lewis du Faur,</hi> a Man of great SenÅ¿e, and of a generous Temper, who added, <hi>That all were agreed that the Differences in Religion had occaÅ¿ioned great DiÅ¿turban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but then</hi> (Å¿aid he) <hi>we ought carefully to enquire, Who cauÅ¿ed theÅ¿e DiÅ¿orders, leÅ¿t as</hi> Elijah <hi>anÅ¿wered</hi> Ahab, <hi>when he reproached him, as the Troubler of</hi> IÅ¿rael, <hi>it might be Å¿aid to us;</hi> It is thou that haÅ¿t troubled IÅ¿rael. Then <hi>Anna du Bourg</hi> beginning with a DiÅ¿courÅ¿e of the Eternal Providence of God, to which all things are Å¿ubject; when he came to the QueÅ¿tion propoÅ¿ed, Å¿aid, There were many Sins and Crimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by Men, which the Laws had already forbidden, and yet the Gallows and Tortures which were imployed, had not been able to prevent the frequent Perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Adulteries, profuÅ¿e LuÅ¿ts, and Profane Oaths, which were not only connived at, but cheriÅ¿hed. On the contrary, every Day new puniÅ¿hments are invented againÅ¿t a Å¿ort of Men, who could never yet be convicted of any wicked Attempt; for how can they injure the Prince, who never name him but in their Prayers for him? Are they accuÅ¿ed of breaking our Laws, perverting the Allegiance of our Cities or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces? No, the greateÅ¿t Tortures could never extort a ConfeÅ¿Å¿ion that they Å¿o much as thought of any Å¿uch thing. Are they not accuÅ¿ed of Sedition only, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e they have by the Candle of Scripture diÅ¿covered the Å¿hameful and encreaÅ¿ing Villanies and corruptions of the Roman Power, which they defire may be reformed? <hi>ChriÅ¿topher Harlay</hi> and <hi>Peter Seguier</hi> the two PreÅ¿idents Å¿aid with great ModeÅ¿ty, that the Court had hitherto juÅ¿tly and rightly diÅ¿charged its Duty in this Particular, and that it would Å¿till do the Å¿ame without changing, to the Glory of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neither the King nor People of <hi>France</hi> would have cauÅ¿e to repent the truÅ¿ting to it. <hi>ChriÅ¿topher de Thou,</hi> with great freedom reflected on the King's Attorney and Advocates, for preÅ¿uming to defame the Proceedings of that Court, and indanger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its Authority. <hi>Renatus Baillet</hi> deÅ¿ired the Judgments which were blamed, might be re-examined, and more maturely conÅ¿idered. <hi>Minart</hi> having made a Å¿hort Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, to Å¿often the Envy which had been raiÅ¿ed againÅ¿t them, only added, That he thought the King's Edicts were to be obÅ¿erved. After theÅ¿e <hi>MaiÅ¿tre</hi> the PreÅ¿ident made a Å¿harp Harangue againÅ¿t the Sectaries, inÅ¿tancing in the Severities which <hi>Philip</hi> the AuguÅ¿t is Å¿aid to have employed againÅ¿t the <hi>AlbingenÅ¿es,</hi> 600 of which he burnt in one day; and in the <hi>WaldenÅ¿es,</hi> which were maÅ¿Å¿acred with Fire and Smoak, partly in their HouÅ¿es, and partly in the Dens and Caves they had fled to.</p>
            <p>The King having obliquely reproached the Court for entring upon this Debate,
<note place="margin">The King's AnÅ¿wer.</note> without his Order, added, <hi>He now clearly Å¿aw, what he had heard before, That there were Å¿ome among them, who deÅ¿piÅ¿ed both his Authority and the Popes. That this was the fault of but a few, but it was diÅ¿honourable to the whole body of them; but only they that were guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Å¿hould Å¿uffer the PuniÅ¿hment. And therefore he exhorted the rest to go on in their Duty.</hi> The Reflections of <hi>la Faur</hi> and <hi>du Bourg,</hi> who mentioned the Story of <hi>Ahab,</hi> and the frequent Adulteries, exaÅ¿perated the King more than the reÅ¿t, and therefore he commanded <hi>Montmorancy</hi> to apprehend them, who again ordered <hi>Gabriel de Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomery,</hi> a Captain of the Guard, to take them and carry them to the <hi>BaÅ¿tile.</hi> After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Paul de Foix, Anthony Fumee, EuÅ¿tace de la Porte,</hi> were alÅ¿o taken into CuÅ¿tody, but la <hi>Ferriere, du Val</hi> and <hi>Viole</hi> were concealed by their Friends, and eÅ¿caped this Storm. Men cenÅ¿ured theÅ¿e Proceedings, as they Å¿tood affected; but the WiÅ¿er were much diÅ¿guÅ¿ted, That the King Å¿hould be Å¿o far impoÅ¿ed on by others, as to come perÅ¿onally into his Court to Å¿ubvert thoÅ¿e Laws he ought to have protected: That he Å¿hould make uÅ¿e of Threats and ImpriÅ¿onments; Å¿aying, That this was a clear InÅ¿tance that he was Å¿ubject to the PaÅ¿Å¿ions of others, and who could think but theÅ¿e things were the forerunners of great Changes?

            <p>To Å¿peak freely without Love or Hatred, he was a Warlike Prince, and too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle affected to the Arts of Peace; but then he was Å¿oft and eaÅ¿ie, and governed too much by others.

And this Impudent Story created a great DeteÅ¿tation of the ProteÅ¿tants, in the Minds of the deluded Catholicks, whoÅ¿e Ears were open to theÅ¿e kinds of MiÅ¿repreÅ¿entations. This lye was carried on with great InduÅ¿try, and theÅ¿e two Wretches were led firÅ¿t to the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and then to the Queen, to communicate this rare Secret,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51585:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>no Man daring to contradict it. The Queen, who was never a Friend to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teÅ¿tants, from henceforth was more than ever enraged againÅ¿t them: But <hi>Oliver,</hi> the Chancellor, Å¿uÅ¿pecting the Story, examined theÅ¿e Lads Å¿eparately, and by their Varying and Contradicting each other, found it to be a mere Lye. But when it was diÅ¿covered Å¿o to be, they went unpuniÅ¿hed, the Hatred againÅ¿t the Sectaries drowning the Voice of Publick JuÅ¿tice.</p>
            <p>However, the Places of Meeting being thus diÅ¿covered, great Numbers of Men and Women were taken and impriÅ¿oned, and others left the Kingdom, whoÅ¿e Goods were Å¿eized and confiÅ¿cated. Many Children were left by their Parents, which filled the Streets with their Cries and Lamentations, to the great Affliction of almoÅ¿t all Men. This Example was Å¿oon after followed at <hi>Poictiers, ToloÅ¿e, Aix,</hi> and generally in the Province of <hi>Narbonne, George d' Armagnac,</hi> the ArchbiÅ¿hop of that See, a Cardinal, imploying all his IntereÅ¿t and InduÅ¿try, that the Å¿uÅ¿pected might be taken up. They were by this time become Å¿o numerous, that their very Number gave them BoldneÅ¿s, which being thus exaÅ¿perated, vented it Å¿elf in Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Reflections on the King, Queen and <hi>GuiÅ¿es;</hi> in which there Å¿eemed to be more than a private Anger and Liberty.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>France</hi> had been a long time afflicted with a tedious Quartane Ague,

It was uncertain whether the <hi>GuiÅ¿es</hi> or their Enemies had invented this Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for different Ends; but the Blame of it was certainly caÅ¿t upon the ProteÅ¿tants, and the King by that means was exaÅ¿perated againÅ¿t them by the <hi>GuiÅ¿es.</hi> The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teÅ¿tants, on the other Å¿ide, put out a Book, to Å¿hew that this Story was invented and fathered on them by the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain.</hi> And after this one of the Spreaders of this Report being executed for it, averred with his laÅ¿t Breath, That he had Orders from the Cardinal Å¿o to do.</p>

By this time Å¿he Å¿aw, to her CoÅ¿t, how neceÅ¿Å¿ary it was for Princes not to break their Faith. For when Å¿he would have gladly come to Peace, there could no reliance be made upon her PromiÅ¿e, and Å¿he had nothing elÅ¿e to engage. And when they demanded the <hi>French</hi> might be Å¿ent away, Å¿he Å¿aid that Å¿he could not do it without order from the King of <hi>France.</hi> So Å¿he was deÅ¿ired to withdraw the GarriÅ¿on out of St. <hi>John</hi>'s-<hi>Town;</hi> which when Å¿he refuÅ¿ed, the <hi>ProteÅ¿tants</hi> marched thither the Twenty fourth of <hi>June,</hi> and in a few days took it.

               <note place="margin">Linlithgow.</note> in the way to <hi>Sterling,</hi> and whereÅ¿oever they prevail'd.

The Regent thereupon marched with her Forces to <hi>Edinburg,</hi> and in the way had a fair opportunity to have fought and overthrown the remainder of their Army, which was prevented by the Duke of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and <hi>James</hi> Earl of <hi>DowglaÅ¿s.</hi> The Twenty fourth of <hi>July</hi> a Truce was made to laÅ¿t till the Tenth of <hi>January;</hi> which the Regent obÅ¿erved Å¿o much the more exactly, becauÅ¿e Å¿he found by Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience that the former breach of PromiÅ¿e had involved her in greater Difficulties and DiÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿es.

That they knew not for the preÅ¿ent how to effect this; but they hoped the Divine GoodneÅ¿s, which had begun the Work, would bring it to its deÅ¿ired End, with the ConfuÅ¿ion of their Enemies: That they earneÅ¿tly deÅ¿ired to enter into a FriendÅ¿hip with the Queen of <hi>England</hi> to the PreÅ¿ervation of which they would Sacrifice their Lives and Fortunes.</q>

            <p>Upon this the Council of <hi>England</hi> began to conÅ¿ider in good earneÅ¿t, and with great Application of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Affairs, it was thought a thing of very ill and dangerous Example, that one Prince Å¿hould undertake the Protection of the Subjects of another Prince, who were in Rebellion: But then it was thought impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous not to aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t thoÅ¿e of the Å¿ame Religion, when perÅ¿ecuted for it. And it was certainly a great Folly, to Å¿uffer the <hi>French,</hi> the Å¿worn Enemies of <hi>England,</hi> when they challenged the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> too, and were at Peace with all the reÅ¿t of the World, to continue armed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> which lay Å¿o near and convenient for the InvaÅ¿ion of <hi>England,</hi> on that Å¿ide which had the greateÅ¿t number of <hi>Roman</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, both of the Nobility and Commons. This was thought a betraying the Safety and Quiet of the whole Nation, in a very cowardly manner: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was concluded, It was no Time now for lazy CounÅ¿els; but that it was beÅ¿t to take up their Arms, and as the <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> CuÅ¿tom was, To prevent their Enemies, and not Å¿tay till they Å¿hould begin with us. It was always as lawful to Prevent an Enemy as to repel him, and to defend our Å¿elves the Å¿ame way that others Attack us. That <hi>England</hi> could never be Safe, but when it was Armed and Potent; and that nothing could contribute more to this End than the Å¿ecuring it againÅ¿t <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> That in order to this the ProteÅ¿tants of <hi>Scotland</hi> were to be protected, and the <hi>French</hi> Forces driven out of it; and this was not to be done by ConÅ¿ulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but by Arms. That the neglect of theÅ¿e Methods had not long Å¿ince loÅ¿t <hi>Calais,</hi> to our great Hindrance and Shame: That a little before, whilÅ¿t the <hi>French</hi> pretended to preÅ¿erve the Peace with great Fidelity, they had Å¿urprized the Fort of <hi>Ambleteul,</hi> and Å¿ome other Places near <hi>Bologne,</hi> and by that means forced the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liÅ¿h</hi> to Å¿urrender that important Place.

            <p>The <hi>French</hi> in the <hi>interim</hi> were not idle, but the Regent reproach'd the <hi>Lords of the Congregation</hi> (Å¿o the <hi>ProteÅ¿tants</hi> were call'd) in a Proclamation, that they had brought <hi>EngliÅ¿hmen</hi> frequently into their HouÅ¿es, that came with MeÅ¿Å¿ages unto them, and returned AnÅ¿wers back to <hi>England;</hi> though they made no AnÅ¿wer to them, becauÅ¿e they did not think it convenient either to deny it, or openly to Avow it for the preÅ¿ent; and the King of <hi>France</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary</hi> wrote each a diÅ¿tinct Letter to the Lord <hi>James Stewart,</hi> threatning him with PuniÅ¿hment as his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s deÅ¿erved, and by Word of Mouth let him know, <hi>That he would rather loÅ¿e the Crown of</hi> France, <hi>than not be revenged on the Seditious Tumults raiÅ¿ed in</hi> Scotland. And one <hi>Octavian,</hi> a French Captain, landed Å¿oon after with a French Regiment, great Sums of Mony and Ammunition of War, and was forthwith Å¿ent back by the Regent for one hundred HorÅ¿e, and four Ships of War; and in the mean time Å¿he fell to Fortifie <hi>IÅ¿ith</hi> or <hi>Leith,</hi> expelling all the former Inhabitants, and making it a Colony of French only, it being a Sea-Port-Town, fit to receive Supplies, and a Place that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:51585:21"/>might Å¿erve the French Companies for a Refuge, if they Å¿hould happen to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to any great Å¿treight. This was done about <hi>September,</hi> as appears by a Letter of the Nobility about it in that Month. The Regent's Reputation was by this time at Å¿o low an Ebb, that nothing Å¿he Å¿aid was believed, and all Å¿he offered Å¿uÅ¿pected.</p>

But failing in this Attempt, the Regent took <hi>Edinburg,</hi> and reÅ¿tored the MaÅ¿s there, and all thoÅ¿e of the contrary Religion were forced to flee into <hi>England,</hi> or where they could find Å¿helter.

            <p>The Lords retired firÅ¿t to <hi>Sterling,</hi> and then to <hi>GlaÅ¿gow,</hi> where they reform'd all things after their uÅ¿ual manner; and in the mean time they Å¿ent <hi>William Maitland</hi> and <hi>Robert Melvil</hi> to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> where at laÅ¿t they obtained what they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿igned in the manner I have expreÅ¿s'd.</p>

That day, <hi>Deligneris</hi> another of the ConÅ¿pirators, and a Captain, repenting the Undertaking, diÅ¿covered it to Queen <hi>Catherine.</hi> The <hi>GuiÅ¿es</hi> had by this time got a good Body of the Nobility about the King, and a Party of the ConÅ¿pirators being met in Arms near <hi>Tours,</hi> the Inhabitants of that City would not endeavour to take them, but Å¿uffered them to eÅ¿cape to <hi>Saumur;</hi> the Seventeenth of <hi>March</hi> was the day now appointed for this great DeÅ¿ign, and <hi>Renaudie,</hi> who knew nothing of the DiÅ¿covery, marched boldly up to <hi>Ambois,</hi> and though great part of his Foot were cut in pieces in the Woods, as they came up in Å¿mall Parties, or taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿oners by the HorÅ¿e who were Å¿ent out for that purpoÅ¿e, many of which were preÅ¿ently hang'd on the Battlements of the CaÅ¿tle, in their Boots and Spurs, yet <hi>Renaudie</hi> their Chief Commander eÅ¿caped, and was not taken then.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>GuiÅ¿e</hi> obtained a CommiÅ¿Å¿ion to conÅ¿titute himÅ¿elf the King's Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant General in <hi>France</hi> the Eighteenth of <hi>March;</hi> and <hi>Oliver</hi> the Chancellor ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, before he would paÅ¿s it, a Pardon for all who Å¿hould lay down their Arms within twenty four hours, and return home with only two or three Companions, giving them liberty to preÅ¿ent what Petitions they pleaÅ¿ed in a peaceable way to the King. The Nineteenth of <hi>March, Renaudie</hi> met <hi>Pardaillan,</hi> who was Å¿ent with a Party of HorÅ¿e to take up Å¿uch as he found in Arms. <hi>Pardaillan</hi> would have fired a PiÅ¿tol againÅ¿t <hi>Renaudie,</hi> but it miÅ¿Å¿ing, <hi>Renaudie</hi> run him through,

And when the Cardinal of <hi>Lorain</hi> viÅ¿ited him in his laÅ¿t SickneÅ¿s, he expreÅ¿s'd his ReÅ¿entments againÅ¿t him, and died weeping and Å¿ighing for what he had done. <hi>Michel de l'HoÅ¿pital,</hi> a great and a good Man, Å¿ucceeded him, by the procurement of Queen <hi>Catherine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though this ConÅ¿piracy was principally deÅ¿ign'd againÅ¿t the <hi>GuiÅ¿es,</hi> yet they deÅ¿ired the World Å¿hould believe theÅ¿e Men had firÅ¿t made a Defection from God by HereÅ¿ie, and then had conÅ¿pired againÅ¿t the King, Queen <hi>Catherine,</hi> and the King's Brothers: The Thirty firÅ¿t of <hi>March</hi> the King wrote to all the Governors of the Å¿everal Provinces, to take great care that the Reliques of this ConÅ¿piracy did not imbroil their Provinces; after which there was the like Account Å¿ent to the Elector <hi>Palatine,</hi> and the reÅ¿t of the ProteÅ¿tant Princes of <hi>Germany.</hi> The Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> thereupon, among other things, <hi>deÅ¿ired the King to conÅ¿ider whether he had not yielded more than was fit to Å¿ome about him</hi> (meaning the <hi>GuiÅ¿es) who out of an inbred Malice and Cruelty exerciÅ¿ed great Cruelties on Men that were never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed of any Crime. There they beÅ¿eech his MajeÅ¿ty, that he would put a Å¿top to the Sufferings of theÅ¿e Innocents, and Å¿eeing they imbrace the Å¿ame Religion with us, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but deÅ¿ire an end may be put to thoÅ¿e cruel and haÅ¿ty Executions.

Some of the Captives who had eÅ¿caped out of the PriÅ¿ons at <hi>Blois,</hi> wrote Letters to the Cardinal of <hi>Lorain,</hi> telling him, they knew the EÅ¿cape of the ConÅ¿pirators was very afflictive to his Eminence: That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were gone to Å¿eek them, and hoped in a Å¿hort time to return better attended.

For That, the greateÅ¿t part of the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:51585:23"/>Men of this Kingdom being weary of what is preÅ¿ent, fearful of what is to come, divided by different Religions, and deÅ¿irous of Change, are willing to imbroil the Kingdom.

<note place="margin">The BiÅ¿hop of <hi>Valence</hi> Å¿econds it.</note> confirmed this Opinion, Å¿hewing the great Corruptions in the Church had given Birth and promoted theÅ¿e DiviÅ¿ions in the Minds of Men, which were rather exaÅ¿perated than extirpated by harÅ¿h means and bloody PerÅ¿ecutions. Then he Å¿hewed the great UÅ¿e of General Councils, for the compoÅ¿ing the Differences in the Church:
<note place="margin">And adviÅ¿eth the King to call a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Council.</note> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he Å¿aid, <hi>He wondred how the Pope could quiet his ConÅ¿cience one Hour, whilÅ¿t he Å¿aw Å¿o many thouÅ¿and Souls periÅ¿h, which God, without doubt, would require at his Hands.

That the Sectaries were worthy of Blame for their Rebellion, and the Roman Catholicks for having been too Bloody and Cruel in the ProÅ¿ecution of them; which had only Å¿erved to irritate the Minds of Men, and make them enquire more greedily into the Opinions of thoÅ¿e they Å¿aw Å¿uffer Å¿o patiently. That the ancient Fathers im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed no other Arms againÅ¿t the Arians, Macedonians and NeÅ¿torians, but the <hi>Word of God,</hi> and the Princes then did only baniÅ¿h Hereticks.</p>
            <p>The ArchbiÅ¿hop of <hi>Vienne</hi> repreÅ¿ented the great Difficulties that hindred the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a General Council; <hi>For</hi> (Å¿aid he) <hi>there is none of us who doth not know what great pains</hi> Charles <hi>V, took to procure a General Council, and what Arts and Stratagems the Poples imployed to defeat that commendable hope this pious Prince had entertained. The DiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaÅ¿e is of too acute a Nature to attend long Delays, which are very uncertain; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the beÅ¿t way was to call a National Council; which the King had already promiÅ¿ed, and the urgent NeceÅ¿Å¿ities of the Church would not Å¿uffer him to delay any longer.</hi> Having Å¿hewn how this had been conÅ¿tantly practiÅ¿ed from the Times of <hi>Clovis</hi> to <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, and Å¿o downward to the times of <hi>Charles</hi> VIII. He concluded, <hi>That the NeceÅ¿Å¿ity being Great, they ought to delay no longer, nor to regard the OppoÅ¿itions the Pope would make against this Method.</hi> For the appeaÅ¿ing the Civil DiÅ¿Å¿entions of <hi>France,</hi> he adviÅ¿ed the calling an AÅ¿Å¿embly of the three EÅ¿tates.</p>
            <p>The third day <hi>Coligni</hi> diÅ¿courÅ¿ed of the Petition he had preÅ¿ented; and being asked, why it was not Å¿ubÅ¿cribed? He Å¿aid, There was above fifty thouÅ¿and Men, in the Nation, ready to Å¿ubÅ¿cribe it: Concluding, <hi>That there was nothing more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitous, than for a Prince to fear his Subjects: And they to be at the Å¿ame time afraid of him. That the HouÅ¿e of God</hi> (the Church) <hi>was to be forthwith reformed, the Army to be diÅ¿handed, and an AÅ¿Å¿embly of the three EÅ¿tates called as Å¿oon as might be.</hi>

That the late ConÅ¿piracy was againÅ¿t the King, and not against his MiniÅ¿ters, as was pretended: That as to what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned Religion, he would Å¿ubmit to Learned Men: But then he protested, That no Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils Å¿hould be of that Authority with him, as to depart in any thing from the Customs of his Ancestors; and eÅ¿pecially in the moÅ¿t Å¿acred MyÅ¿tery of the Lord's Supper: And as to an AÅ¿Å¿embly of the States, he Å¿ubmitted that intirely to the King.</hi> He concluded, The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries were a Seditious, Proud Å¿ort of Men, and that <hi>the GoÅ¿pel and Faith of ChriÅ¿t was made an occaÅ¿ion of Tumults and Seditions by them, and therefore they were to be Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely proÅ¿ecuted.</hi> Yet he was for mitigating the Severity of the Laws towards Å¿uch, as met peaceably without Arms, who were to be reduced to their Duty by more gentle Methods, more than by Force. <hi>To which purpoÅ¿e he would freely Å¿pend his Life. That the BiÅ¿hops and Curates Å¿hould by their preÅ¿ence redeem the Time they had loÅ¿t,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:51585:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>and the Governours of the Provinces be forced to do their Duties. But then, Å¿ince there was nothing under Debate, but want of DiÅ¿cipline, and Corruption of Manners, it Å¿eemed very unneceÅ¿Å¿ary, that either a General or a National Council Å¿hould be called.</hi> The free ConfeÅ¿Å¿ion of this Cardinal, is the Opinion of the whole Party; and though the name of a General Council makes a great noiÅ¿e, yet we very well know how they have treated the ancienteÅ¿t and beÅ¿t Councils, when they have in any thing croÅ¿Å¿ed their Humors or IntereÅ¿ts, and from thence may conclude, They will never Å¿ubmit to any that Å¿hall not be conformable to their Wills.</p>

Yet were they invited to Court by the King, to purge themÅ¿elves of the SuÅ¿picion, upon a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿e they Å¿hould receive no Injury: But this they wiÅ¿ely refuÅ¿ed as not ReaÅ¿on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
            <p>This and Å¿everal other Å¿uch alarms procured an Edict, <hi>That no Prince or other perÅ¿on, of what condition Å¿oever, Å¿hould provide Money, Soldiers, Arms or HorÅ¿es; and if any PerÅ¿on did otherwiÅ¿e, it Å¿hould be taken for High-TreaÅ¿on.</hi> The Cardinal of <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,</hi> was alÅ¿o imployed to bring the Princes of his Family to Court, by paÅ¿Å¿ing his Faith to them, That nothing Å¿hould be done againÅ¿t them.

The thirteenth of <hi>November</hi> the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> was examined by the Chancellor and others, in PriÅ¿on: Who told them, It belonged not to them to try or examine the Princes of the Blood, but to the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> and the Peers of <hi>France,</hi> and the whole Body of the States. <hi>Bourdin</hi> the Attorney General, at laÅ¿t told him, That if he declined the Judgment of theÅ¿e Delegates, he Å¿hould be taken for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict, and Sentence accordingly pronounced againÅ¿t him, as guilty of High TreaÅ¿on, and the WitneÅ¿s Å¿hould be examined elÅ¿ewhere. Perceiving by this the head-long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haÅ¿t of the <hi>GuiÅ¿es,</hi> his Lady delivered a Petition to the King, for learned Council, which was granted him: But his Servants were taken from him, and he was denied a Conference with his Brother of <hi>Navarr</hi> and the Cardinal, though he deÅ¿ired Å¿ome of the Kings MiniÅ¿ters might be preÅ¿ent. TheÅ¿e HardÅ¿hips created him much Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paÅ¿Å¿ion in the Minds of Men, and they thought he was hardly uÅ¿ed, which made his Enemies yet more hated. They on the other hand deÅ¿piÅ¿ed the Thoughts of Men, and bent all their Thoughts how they might deÅ¿troy the King of <hi>Navarr,</hi> for they thought they were Å¿ecure of <hi>Conde.</hi> Among other ways, they intended to have aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿aÅ¿Å¿inated him in the King's Chamber; of which an account was given him by Å¿ome of <hi>GuiÅ¿e</hi> his Creatures. Upon which he reÅ¿olved to draw his Sword and dye fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if he were thus attacked; and deÅ¿ired an old Friend to take care to preÅ¿erve his Bloody Cloaths, and Å¿hew them to his Son. When he had thus done, he went unÅ¿ent for into the King's Chamber, and taking the King by the Hand, Å¿o by his Looks prevailed upon him, that his Heart failed him, and he either repented, or durÅ¿t not proceed in this DeÅ¿ign. Queen <hi>Catharine</hi> was already weary of the InÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the <hi>GuiÅ¿es,</hi> and deÅ¿irous to Å¿ave the HouÅ¿e of <hi>Bourbon</hi> as a Curb upon them; to this purpoÅ¿e Å¿he gave order to the Chancellor, to put what Rubs he could in their way. The <hi>GuiÅ¿es,</hi> in the mean time, haÅ¿tned the Tryal of <hi>Conde,</hi> as much as was poÅ¿Å¿ible, eÅ¿teeming all Delays dangerous to them.</p>

The twenty Å¿ixth of that Month the Kings DiÅ¿eaÅ¿e grew very great and hopeleÅ¿s: This turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Rage and Fury of the <hi>GuiÅ¿es</hi> into Fear and ConÅ¿ternation, when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿idered what they Å¿hould loÅ¿e in the Death of that Prince. Thereupon they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to work upon Queen <hi>Catharine,</hi> by other Methods, to flatter and crouch to her, and to repreÅ¿ent the King of <hi>Navarr</hi> and Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> as exaÅ¿perated to that height by their late Sufferings, that without doubt they would Å¿eek her Ruine; but they for their Parts would Å¿tand by her, and Å¿erve her with great Fidelity. They deÅ¿ired therefore <hi>Navarr</hi> might be committed as well as his Brother had been, before the King dyed. The Chancellor prevented this by Å¿hewing, in a grave Oration, That it would certainly involve <hi>France</hi> in a Civil War. The fifth of <hi>December</hi> the King dyed, having lived Å¿eventeen years and ten Months, and reigned one Year, five Months and twenty Days. His Youth, and the Å¿hort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s of his Reign, makes it uncertain whether he ought to be ranged with the Good or Bad Princes; and the more, becauÅ¿e not he but the <hi>GuiÅ¿es</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned.</p>

But then God is not the Author of DiÅ¿Å¿ention, but of Peace; and other Religions, becauÅ¿e falÅ¿e, may be founded and preÅ¿erved by Force and Fraud; but the ChriÅ¿tian Religion, which is the only true, is only to be eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed by Patience, JuÅ¿tice, Prayers and Tears: The ancient ChriÅ¿tians accordingly choÅ¿e rather to be Kill'd than to Kill, and Signed the Truth of their Religion with their Bloods: And yet it cannot be denied but that a falÅ¿e Religion is a very powerful Exciter of the Minds of Men, and Å¿urmounts all other PaÅ¿Å¿ions, and unites Men more Å¿trongly than any other thing; Å¿o that we muÅ¿t confeÅ¿s that Kingdoms are divided in effect more by their Religions, than by their Bounds; and therefore it daily happens, that thoÅ¿e that are poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿s'd by an Opinion of Religion, have little regard to their Prince, their Country, Wives and Children; and from hence Å¿prings Rebellions, DiÅ¿Å¿entions and Revolts. And in the Å¿ame HouÅ¿e, if they are divided in Religion, the Husband cannot agree with the Wife and Children, nor one Brother with another. That therefore a Remedy might be had for Å¿o great a Calamity, it had been decreed at <hi>Fountain-bleau,</hi> That there was need of a Council, and the Pope having Å¿ince declared there Å¿hould Å¿uddenly be one, that Men ought not in the mean time to hammer ont for themÅ¿elves new Religions, Rites and Ceremonies, according to their own Fancies. For this would not only endanger the publick Peace, but the Salvation of their Souls too. That if the Pope and the Council fail'd, the King would take the Å¿ame Care his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿tors had, and provide for the Peace and Welfare of his Kingdom: That it was to be hoped the BiÅ¿hops would for the future exerciÅ¿e their Functions with greater Care and Diligence: That the Cure might come from that Fountain which had cauÅ¿ed the DiÅ¿temper: That they ought to arm themÅ¿elves with Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, Good Manners, and the Word of God, which are the Arms of Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants, and then go out to War againÅ¿t our Enemies, and not imitate unskilful Captains, who disfurniÅ¿h their Walls to make an Irruption. The DiÅ¿courÅ¿e of one that lives well, is very perÅ¿uaÅ¿ive, but the Sword has no other power over the Soul than to deÅ¿troy it with the Body. Our AnceÅ¿tors overcame their Sectaries with their Piety, and we ought to imitate them if we would not be thought rather to hate the Men than their Vices. Let us therefore, Å¿aid he, pray daily for them, that they may be reduced from their Errors, and diÅ¿charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hateful Names of <hi>Lutherans, Huguenots</hi> and <hi>PapiÅ¿ts,</hi> which were intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the Enemy of Mankind, and are too like the ancient Factions of <hi>Guelfs</hi> and <hi>Gibellins,</hi> let us only retain the Ancient Appellation of <hi>ChriÅ¿tians.</hi> But then, becauÅ¿e there are many who only pretend Religion, but are in Truth led by Ambition, Avarice and Novelty, it is fit to Å¿uppreÅ¿s theÅ¿e Men in the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:51585:26"/>very beginning: TheÅ¿e are the Men that ought to be kept under by the Force of Arms.</q>

            <p>When the States came to debate,
<note place="margin">A Difficulty propoÅ¿ed.</note> the <hi>Clergy</hi> and the <hi>Commons</hi> were of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That their Powers were determined by the Death of the late King; and that they ought to return Home: Which was over-ruled by the King of <hi>Navar</hi> and the Council; And they were ordered to proceed; becauÅ¿e by the Law of <hi>France</hi> the King never dies; but the Lawful SucceÅ¿Å¿ion is tranÅ¿mitted without any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. The Cardinal of <hi>Lorraine</hi> had deÅ¿ign'd in the former Reign to make a Speech in the Name of the three EÅ¿tates; which was then not oppoÅ¿ed, but now the Commons would not Å¿uffer it, becauÅ¿e contrary to the Ancient UÅ¿age: And for that they had Å¿ome things to object againÅ¿t the Cardinal him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jean l' Ange,</hi> an Advocate of the Parliament of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Deputy of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons Å¿peaks againÅ¿t the Clergy.</note> Å¿poke for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and remarked three great Faults in the Clergy, <hi>Ignorance, CovetouÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s</hi> and <hi>ExceÅ¿Å¿ive Luxury,</hi> which had given Being to the new Errors, and Scandal to the People. That the Preaching of the Word of God, which was the chief cauÅ¿e of the inÅ¿tituting BiÅ¿hops, was totally neglected; and they thought it a Å¿hameful thing, and beneath their Dignity: And by their Example, the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates had learned to neglect their Duty too, and had ordered the MaÅ¿s to be Å¿ung by Illiterate and Unworthy <hi>Stipendaries.</hi> That the exceÅ¿Å¿ive Pomp and Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice of the Clergy (who pretended by it to promote the Glory of God) had raiÅ¿ed an Envy and an hatred of them in the Minds of the People.

            <p>
               <hi>Jean Quintin le Bourguinon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Clergy apologize for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves.</note> made a long tedious Speech in the behalf of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, to Å¿hew; I. That the AÅ¿Å¿embly of the three EÅ¿tates were inÅ¿tituted for the providing for the Sacred DiÅ¿cipline. II. That the King might underÅ¿tand the Complaints of his People, and provide for the NeceÅ¿Å¿ities of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, by their Advice, and not for the Reformation of the Church, <hi>Which could not Err, and which neither hath, nor ever Å¿hall have the leaÅ¿t Spot or Wrinkle, but Å¿hall ever be Beautiful:</hi> But then he ingenuouÅ¿ly confeÅ¿t, That the <hi>Sacred DiÅ¿cip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line</hi> was very much declined from its Ancient Simplicity. That therefore the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vivers of the the Ancient HereÅ¿ies were not to be heard; and all that had Meetings Å¿eparate from the Catholicks, were to be eÅ¿teemed Favourers of <hi>Sectaries,</hi> and to be puniÅ¿hed. Therefore he deÅ¿ired the King to compel all his Subjects, within his Dominions, to Live and Believe according to the Form preÅ¿cribed by the Church. That the InÅ¿olence of the Sectaries was no longer to be endured, who deÅ¿piÅ¿ing the Authority of the Ancients, and the Doctrine received by the Church, would be thought alone to underÅ¿tand and imbrace the GoÅ¿pel. That this was the next Å¿tep to a Rebellion, and that they would Å¿hortly Å¿hake off the Yoak of the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿trate, and with the Å¿ame BoldneÅ¿s fight againÅ¿t their Prince, that they now im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed againÅ¿t the Church, if Care were not Å¿peedily taken. He deÅ¿ired that all Commerce between them and the Catholicks might be forbidden, and that they might be treated like Enemies, and that thoÅ¿e who were gone out of the Kingdom on the account of Religion, might be baniÅ¿hed. That it was the King's Duty to draw the Civil Sword, and put all thoÅ¿e to Death, who were infected with HereÅ¿ie; to defend the Clergy, and reÅ¿tore the Elections of BiÅ¿hops to the Chapters, the want of which had cauÅ¿ed great Damages to the Church. That it had been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erved, That the very Year the Pope granted the King the Nomination of BiÅ¿hops, this SchiÅ¿m began, and has ever Å¿ince Å¿pread it Å¿elf; for in the 1517, <hi>Luther, Zuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glius</hi> and <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> Å¿et up, and <hi>Calvin</hi> followed them. This Speech incenÅ¿ed the whole AÅ¿Å¿embly againÅ¿t him, and eÅ¿pecially the ProteÅ¿tants, who publiÅ¿hed Å¿o many Libels and Satyrs againÅ¿t him, that he Å¿oon after died of Shame and Grief. He was no ill Man, but was a better <hi>DecretaliÅ¿t</hi> than a Divine; and had never well thought whether a Reformation were needfull or no, But then it ought alÅ¿o to have
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:51585:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>been conÅ¿idered that he did not Å¿peak his own Single judgment, but had his matter preÅ¿cribed him by the Clergy for whom he Å¿poke.</p>
            <p>After Å¿ome days, the King Signified to the BiÅ¿hops, that they Å¿hould prepare themÅ¿elves for the Council, which was now recall'd at <hi>Trent;</hi> and the Judges and Prefects were commanded to diÅ¿charge all that were ImpriÅ¿on'd for Religion only, and leave all that were Å¿uÅ¿pected, the free injoyment of their EÅ¿tates and Goods; And it was made Capital to reproach, or injure one the other, on the Account of Religion. After which the AÅ¿Å¿emly was <hi>Prorogued</hi> to the Month of <hi>May,</hi> of the next Year.</p>
            <p>There was in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> a Valley called by the Name of <hi>PeroÅ¿ia,</hi> and St. <hi>Martin;</hi> Inhabited by about 15000 Souls, whoÅ¿e AnceÅ¿tors about 400 Years Å¿ince had upon the Preaching of <hi>Waldus,

That they believed the Supreme civil MagiÅ¿trates were InÅ¿tituted by God, and they were to be obeyed, and that who Å¿oever reÅ¿iÅ¿ted them, Å¿ought againÅ¿t God. They Å¿aid they had received this Doctrin from their AnceÅ¿tors, and that if they were in any error they were ready to receive inÅ¿truction from the Word of God, and would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ently renounce any heretical or erroneous Doctrin which Å¿hould be Å¿o Å¿hewen to them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thereupon a Solemn DiÅ¿pute was in Å¿hew, appointed concerning the Sacrifice of the MaÅ¿s, Auricular ConfeÅ¿Å¿ion, Tradition, Prayers and Oblations for the Dead, and the Ceremonies of the Church and her CenÅ¿ures; all which were rejected by them, they alledging that they were humane Inventions, and contrary to the Word of God. This ConfeÅ¿Å¿ion was Å¿ent by the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> to the King of <hi>France,</hi> who about a year after return'd AnÅ¿wer, That he had cauÅ¿ed it to be Examin'd by his lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Divines; who had all condemn'd it as Erroneous and contrary to true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and therefore the King commanded them to reject this ConfeÅ¿Å¿ion and to Submit to the Holy Church of Rome; and if they did not do Å¿o, their PerÅ¿ons and EÅ¿tates Å¿hould be ConfiÅ¿cated. But they on the contrary were reÅ¿olved to Å¿tand by their former ConfeÅ¿Å¿ion. They were thereupon commanded not to admit any Teacher who was not Å¿ent by the ArchbiÅ¿hop of <hi>Turin,</hi> or the Council there; and that if any Teachers came among them from <hi>Geneva</hi> they Å¿hould diÅ¿cover or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend them, upon pain of Death, and loÅ¿s of all they had. For three years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, the people of this PerÅ¿waÅ¿ion were let alone and no way moleÅ¿ted; but this Year the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> much againÅ¿t his will and Inclination, was drawn by the Pope to make a War upon them. In the begining of <hi>March, Jean de Carquignau,</hi> and one <hi>Mathurim</hi> and his Wife were taken and burnt; and Å¿everal of the Neighbour Valleys were Plundred, Å¿everal of the Inhabitants were put to death; and about Sixty Å¿ent to the Gallies, and Å¿ome recanted and profeÅ¿s'd the Roman Catholick Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. After this one <hi>Thomas Jacomel</hi> a <hi>Dominican,</hi> was Å¿ent with one <hi>Turbis</hi> for his AÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tant, who was a bloody man, to inquire diligently and Å¿everely into all that were Å¿uÅ¿pected; but the Nobility interpoÅ¿ing, there was no great Severity Å¿hewn. The Monks of the Abbey of <hi>Pignoral,</hi> which was Å¿eated in the Entry of the Valley, on the other Å¿ide, kept a parcel of Souldiers in Pay; and trapping as many of theÅ¿e Poor Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as they could, as they paÅ¿Å¿ed to and fro, they uÅ¿ed them very cruelly; and Å¿ome others of the Nobility did the Å¿ame thing; and a Sedition following upon it, they fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the poor Inhabitants One ThouÅ¿and Å¿ix Hundred Crowns. Upon this a Å¿harp war inÅ¿ued, which ended in the Ruine of the AggreÅ¿Å¿ors of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The PaÅ¿tor alÅ¿o of <hi>PeroÅ¿ia,</hi> was taken and burnt with a Å¿low, Fire with many of his Flock, and the Inhabitants were Å¿poiled of all they had, and forced to flee to the Mountains. Being thus inraged with hard UÅ¿ages, in the Month of <hi>July,</hi> Fifty of them Å¿et upon One Hundred and Twenty Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers belonging to the Abbey of <hi>Pignoral,</hi> put them to flight, and flew the greateÅ¿t part of them; and about Four Hundred more of their party coming up,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:51585:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>they took the Abbey of <hi>Pignoral,</hi> and delivered all their people which were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priÅ¿oned there. In <hi>October</hi> following News being brought that the Duke of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi> was Å¿ending an Army to deÅ¿troy them; <hi>They reÅ¿olved that it was not lawful to take Arms againÅ¿t their Prince, but that they would take what they could carry away, and betake themÅ¿elves to the Mountains, and there attend the good pleaÅ¿ure of God, who never forÅ¿akes his own, and can turn the Hearts of Princes which way he pleaÅ¿eth.</hi> There was not one Man amongÅ¿t them who repined againÅ¿t this Decree. In after times they had PaÅ¿tors who taught them otherwiÅ¿e, and <hi>told them it was not their Prince, but the Pope that they reÅ¿iÅ¿ted, and that they fought not for their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but for their Wives and Children.</hi> The Å¿econd of <hi>November</hi> the Forces of the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> entered their Borders, and the Soldiers attempting to get above them, they betook themÅ¿elves to their Slings, and maintained a Fight againÅ¿t them (though they were but few in number) the Å¿pace of a whole day, with no great loÅ¿s. At laÅ¿t the General finding they were not to be forced, gave them leave to Petition the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> 
               <q>That they might live in Peace, aÅ¿Å¿uring him that nothing but utter ruin coald have forced them to take Arms againÅ¿t him: for which they humbly implored his HighneÅ¿s's Pardon, and begging the Liberty of their ConÅ¿ciences, and that they might not be forced to Å¿ubmit to the Traditions of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> but might, with his good leave, enjoy the Religion they had learned from their AnceÅ¿tors.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Petition was Å¿econded by the DucheÅ¿s of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who was a merciful PrinceÅ¿s, a and had great Power over the Affections of the Duke. It being ever her judgment <hi>that this People were not to be Å¿o Å¿everely uÅ¿ed, who had not changed their Religion a few days agon, but had been in PoÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion of it from their AnceÅ¿tors Å¿o many Ages.</hi> Upon this they were to be received to mercy; but the Soldiery fell upon them, when they Å¿uÅ¿pected nothing, and Plundered them three days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. The General Å¿eemed to be much concerned at this breach of Faith: yet after this they were fined eight thouÅ¿and Crowns, which they were forced to borrow on great UÅ¿ury, and they were alÅ¿o commanded to bring all their Arms into the CaÅ¿tles the Duke had GarriÅ¿oned in their Country. And at laÅ¿t they were commanded to eject all their PaÅ¿tors (which was granted with the tears of their People) that they might avoid the fury of the Soldiers. The General pretended not to be Å¿atisfied that their PaÅ¿tors were in good truth gone, and when they Å¿uffered them to Å¿earch their HouÅ¿es, the Soldiers Plundered them again, and then burnt their Town. There was one Town called <hi>Angrogne,</hi> in a Valley of the Å¿ame name, the General pretended to Å¿hew them more favour, and agreed that they Å¿hould have one PaÅ¿tor left them: but they forced him alÅ¿o to flee into the Mountains afterwards, and Plundered his HouÅ¿e, and all his Neighbours, and then injoyned the <hi>Sindicks</hi> (who are their chief MagiÅ¿trates) to find up, and bring in the PaÅ¿tor; threatning that otherwiÅ¿e they would burn and deÅ¿troy the whole Territory; and when they had Å¿o done then they withdrew.</p>
            <p>In the mean time their MeÅ¿Å¿engers were gone with the Petition, mentioned above, to the Duke to <hi>Vercelli,</hi> where they attended forty days before they could get Audience, and then they were forced to promiÅ¿e they would admit the MaÅ¿s, and when the Prince had upon theÅ¿e terms forgiven their taking Arms againÅ¿t him, they were commanded to ask Pardon too of the Popes <hi>Nuncio,</hi> which at laÅ¿t they did. During their abÅ¿ence, the Inhabitants of <hi>Angrogne</hi> had Å¿uffered no Sermons but in private, that they might not exaÅ¿perate the Prince, or make the Affairs of their Deputies more difficult. But they reÅ¿olved when theÅ¿e were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned they would exerciÅ¿e their Religion openly, and not give any thing to the maintaining of the Soldiers, whether their RequeÅ¿t were granted or denied.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of <hi>January</hi> the Deputies returned,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1561</label> and when their Principals underÅ¿tood what had been done, they wrote to the reÅ¿t of the Valleys to give them an account of it; and deÅ¿ired a publick GonÅ¿ultation or Diet. At which it was reÅ¿olved that they Å¿hould all joyn in a League to defend their Religion, which they believed was agreeable to the Word of God, profeÅ¿Å¿ing in the mean time to obey their Prince according to the Commandments of God, and that they would for the future make no Agreement, or Peace, but by a common ConÅ¿ent, in which the freedom of their Religion Å¿hould be Å¿aved. Upon this they grew more Confident, refuÅ¿ed the Conditions offered by the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and the promiÅ¿es made by their Deputies. And the next day they entered into the Church of <hi>Bobbi,</hi> in Arms, and broke down all the Images and Altars, and after a Sermon,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:51585:28"/>marching to <hi>Villar,</hi> where they intended to do the like, they met the Soldiers (who had heard what was done) going to Plunder <hi>Bobbi,</hi> Å¿topped them, and with their Slings Å¿o pelted them, that they were glad to Å¿hift for their lives, and left theÅ¿e Reformers to do the Å¿ame thing at <hi>Villar.</hi> The Captain of <hi>Turin</hi> attempting to Å¿top this Rage was beaten, and the Dukes Officers were glad to Å¿eek to their PaÅ¿tors for a PaÅ¿port. After this they beat the Captain of <hi>Turin</hi> in a Å¿econd Fight. By this time the whole Army drew into the Field, and the Inhabitants of theÅ¿e Valleys not being able to reÅ¿iÅ¿t them, they burnt all their Towns and HouÅ¿es, and deÅ¿troyed all the People they took. In theÅ¿e Broils <hi>Monteil,</hi> one of the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s Chief Officers, was Å¿lain by a Lad of eighteen years of age; and <hi>Truchet,</hi> another of them, by a Dwarf. The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> had Å¿ent Å¿even thouÅ¿and Soldiers to deÅ¿troy this handful of Men; and yet Å¿uch was their Rage and DeÅ¿peration, and the Advantage of their Country, that they beat his Soldiers whereÅ¿oever they met them. And in all theÅ¿e Fights their Enemies obÅ¿erved that they had Å¿lain only fourteen of the Inhabitants, and thence concluded that God fought for them. So the <hi>Savoyards</hi> began to treat of a Peace, which at laÅ¿t was concluded to the Advantage of theÅ¿e poor deÅ¿picable People. The Duke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the eight thouÅ¿and Crowns they were to pay by the former Treaty, and Å¿uffering them to enjoy the Liberty of their Religion: <hi>So that he got nothing by this War but loÅ¿s and Å¿hame, the ruin of his People on both Å¿ides, and the deÅ¿olating of his Country.</hi>

The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> in the mean time was declared Innocent by the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> the Thirteenth of <hi>June,</hi> and his DiÅ¿charge Recorded.

<note place="margin">An Edict to reÅ¿train them.</note> This neceÅ¿Å¿itated the Council to forbid all Reviling ExpreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ions, and all Tumults on the Accounts of Religion; And by it, all that had been baniÅ¿hed for Religion in the Reign of <hi>Francis</hi> II. were invited to return, and promiÅ¿ed, they Å¿hould enjoy their Goods and EÅ¿tates, if they would live like good Catholicks for the future, or otherwiÅ¿e might Å¿ell them, and retire elÅ¿ewhere; which was after oppoÅ¿ed by the Parliament at <hi>Paris,</hi> but yet many returned on that account, and many that were in PriÅ¿on were diÅ¿charged, Å¿o that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teÅ¿tant Party appeared numerous.

               </note> that he was fondly perÅ¿waded, he could confute all the Doctrines of the ProteÅ¿tants out of the Fathers, and thereby acquire a great Reputation to himÅ¿elf, if he could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a Conference with their PaÅ¿tors.

<note place="margin">The Three EÅ¿tates of <hi>France</hi> AÅ¿Å¿em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at <hi>Pont-OyÅ¿e.</hi>
               </note> the Agreement between the Queen Regent and the King of <hi>Navar</hi> was Confirm'd by the three EÅ¿tates, which was very difficultly obtain'd by the later. This AÅ¿Å¿embly was opened at St. <hi>Germain,</hi> where <hi>James Bretagne d'Autum,</hi> who Å¿poke for the Commons, declaiming Å¿harply againÅ¿t the Ignorance of the PrieÅ¿ts, and the Corrupt Manners and Depraved DiÅ¿cipline of the Clergy, Å¿o that they were unfit to Lead or InÅ¿truct the People, but rather diÅ¿guÅ¿ted and diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ed them, doing all things for Hire, and nothing as their Duty, enÅ¿laving themÅ¿elves to PleaÅ¿ures, and wallowing in Luxury and IdleneÅ¿s. To this he aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿igned the Calamities which at preÅ¿ent oppreÅ¿s'd <hi>France.</hi> He therefore moved the King to take away all their JuriÅ¿diction, that he Å¿hould employ their over-great Riches to Pious UÅ¿es, and call a National Council, which was the only preÅ¿ent and certain Cure of thoÅ¿e Evils; That free PaÅ¿ports Å¿hould be given to all that would come to it, and, that the King or Å¿ome of the Princes of the Blood Å¿hould preÅ¿ide in it, whilÅ¿t BuÅ¿ineÅ¿s of Religion was debated; That the late Decree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t Conventicles Å¿hould be no prejudice to thoÅ¿e of the Reformed Religion, who rejected the Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor any PreÅ¿cription as to length of time, <hi>which could not make what in it Å¿elf was falÅ¿e, true; and the BuÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s of Religion was to be quietly and friendly debated according to the Word of God, and not with the Sword and Reproaches.</hi> He that Å¿poke for the Nobility, excuÅ¿ed the Clergy, and deÅ¿ired the King to preÅ¿erve their Priviledges and Dignities. But then he moved, to have the greateÅ¿t part of the Church Lands Å¿old to pay the Debts of the Crown, pretending, that a third part of the ParchaÅ¿e Money put out to UÅ¿e, would be as good to them as the whole Land. That the Edict of <hi>July</hi> might be recall'd, and only multiplicity of Sects, and ill Language, under the pretence of Liberty, prohibited. That a National Council might be call'd, in which the King Å¿hould preÅ¿ide. That all JuriÅ¿dictions Å¿hould be taken from the Church, and annexed to the Crown. There were alÅ¿o many other things demanded in this AÅ¿Å¿embly, which tended to the Ruine of the Clergy, the Papal Authority growing into Contempt, and the greateÅ¿t part, either out of a deÅ¿ire to promote Piety,
<note place="margin">The Clergy of <hi>France</hi> give the King Taxes to Å¿ave their Revenues and JuriÅ¿di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</note> or of Love to Novelty, favouring the ProteÅ¿tant Party, and daily increaÅ¿ing their numbers by joyning with them.</p>
            <p>The Clergy to prevent this Storm wiÅ¿ely gave the King four Tenths for Å¿ix years, which very much appeaÅ¿ed the King and the Principal Courtiers towards them.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:51585:30"/>The Queen, by the Advice of <hi>Monluc</hi> BiÅ¿hop of <hi>Valence,</hi> wrote about this time a long Letter to the Pope, dated the 5th of <hi>AuguÅ¿t,</hi>

That if yet the <hi>Latine</hi> muÅ¿t be uÅ¿ed, it were fit an Interpretation Å¿hould be made of the Prayers in the Vulgar Tongue; That the Receiving of the PrieÅ¿t in the Sacrifice of the MaÅ¿s, the People only looking Idely on, is contrary to the InÅ¿titution; That the <hi>PÅ¿alms</hi> ought to be in the Vulgar Tongue, and alÅ¿o the Private Prayers of the People; That theÅ¿e things might be granted without derogating from the Papal Authority.</q> The Pope was infinitely offended with this Letter, and the more, becauÅ¿e of the fame of a National Council Å¿hortly to be holden in <hi>France;</hi> but then he diÅ¿Å¿embled his ReÅ¿entment, and became the more Å¿incere in the AÅ¿Å¿em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling a General Council, which he had rather promiÅ¿ed than deÅ¿igned before.</p>

He Asked a Day to AnÅ¿wer in, and prayed the King that he would perÅ¿evere in the Religion of his AnceÅ¿tors.

As to the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> in effect, he Å¿aid, That if the <hi>ProteÅ¿tants</hi> would not embrace their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, there was no hope of an Agreement. The Cardinal of <hi>Tournon</hi> thereupon applauded his Harangue, and Å¿aid, he was ready to lay down his Life for this Faith, intreating the King to continue Å¿tedfaÅ¿t in it, and was contented (Good Man!) that if the ProteÅ¿tants would Å¿ubÅ¿cribe theÅ¿e two Points, they Å¿hould be admitted to diÅ¿pute all the reÅ¿t; but if they refuÅ¿ed this, all hearing was to be denied them, and they were to be expell'd out of his Dominions. <hi>Beza</hi> deÅ¿ired to AnÅ¿wer him Extempore, but the King delayed the AnÅ¿wer to the next day.</p>

The Queen was much enraged at the InÅ¿olence of this Man, but, out of Reverence to the Legate, Å¿uppreÅ¿s'd her reÅ¿entment; after this Day there were no more Publick Conferences, but they Drew out three of a Side, and endeavoured to form Å¿uch an ExpoÅ¿ition of the Lord's Supper as both Parties might agree in, which in the End proved impoÅ¿Å¿ible to be done, and Å¿o the Conference of <hi>PoiÅ¿Å¿i</hi> ended, which was the firÅ¿t Liberty that was granted to diÅ¿pute the EÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed Religion in <hi>France;</hi> and was blamed by Å¿ome as a thing of ill Example, and approved by others as the only means left to prevent the Storm which hung over their heads.

            <p>The beginning of the Year 1562, was very unquiet in <hi>France.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>French</hi> Affairs.</note> The King had called an AÅ¿Å¿embly of the Delegates of all the Parliaments of <hi>France,</hi> in the end of the laÅ¿t year, which was to meet at St. <hi>Germain</hi> the 17th of <hi>January</hi> of this year, to conÅ¿ider of the means of appeaÅ¿ing theÅ¿e Broils, and preÅ¿erving the Peace of <hi>France.</hi> The King opened this AÅ¿Å¿embly with a Å¿hort Speech, which was Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by a larger, made by the Chancellor; who having given a Å¿hort account of the Å¿everal Edicts, that had been made before in the buÅ¿ineÅ¿s of Religion; and Å¿hewn how they had all, by one means or other, been defeated. He added, That <hi>Laws were of no uÅ¿e, if they were not ReligiouÅ¿ly obÅ¿erved. But then,</hi> (Å¿aid he) <hi>if the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:51585:35"/>QueÅ¿tion is put, Why are not the Laws executed? MuÅ¿t not you, that are the Judges, bear the blame? For if they excuÅ¿e themÅ¿elves, and Å¿ay, That it was not in their power to execute them, I will accept the AnÅ¿wer, upon condition they will ingenuouÅ¿ly confeÅ¿s, That neither was it in the King's power: And that this Affair of Religion, by a Å¿ecret Judgment of God, for the ChaÅ¿tiÅ¿ement of our Luxury, Indevotion, and Neglect of his Glory, is Å¿o diÅ¿poÅ¿ed, that we may, by the Å¿everity of the PuniÅ¿hment, be brought to Repentance. In the year</hi> 1518, <hi>when theÅ¿e Commotions firÅ¿t began, there is no Man but knows, how corrupt the Manners, and how looÅ¿e, or rather profligate, the DiÅ¿cipline of the Church was throughout the World: For, to omit the Court of</hi> Rome, <hi>in which, there was nothing right and Å¿ound, we had here in</hi> France <hi>a young King, brought up in PleaÅ¿ures, tho' he afterwards was much improved, but he was then very diÅ¿Å¿olute; nor was</hi> Henry <hi>of</hi> England <hi>any better: And after all the Judgments God has Å¿ent from Heaven upon us, we have not repented or amended; and therefore, there is no wonder, that this Å¿ad difference of Religion cannot be compoÅ¿ed, and the Peace of the Church reÅ¿tored. No, on the contrary it is now apparent, that our Enemies are become Å¿o numerous, that they are almoÅ¿t able to oppreÅ¿s us. As to thoÅ¿e who pretend, that we have encreaÅ¿ed them by our Connivance, I can anÅ¿wer, That during the minority of the King, they are bolder, and I would have them conÅ¿ider too, that, for our Sins, God has Å¿et a Child over us. There are Å¿ome, who would have the King arm one part of his Subjects againÅ¿t the other, which, I think, is neither ChriÅ¿tian, nor Human.</hi> After very much to the Å¿ame purpoÅ¿e, he told them, the Thing propoÅ¿ed by the King to their ConÅ¿idera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was, <hi>Whether it was the beÅ¿t way for the King to SuppreÅ¿s the Meetings, or to Tolerate them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thereupon followed a very great Debate between theÅ¿e Deputies of the Å¿everal Parliaments of <hi>France,</hi>

<note place="margin">The Edict of <hi>January,</hi> which granted Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ConÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the ProteÅ¿tants.</note> and accordingly a new Edict was made, which was called, <hi>The Edict of January,</hi> the principal Heads of which, were theÅ¿e: <q>That the <hi>ProteÅ¿tants</hi> Å¿hould reÅ¿tore the EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticks to their Churches, HouÅ¿es, Lands, Tithes, and other goods whatÅ¿oever which they had taken from them forthwith, and Å¿uffer them peaceably to enjoy their Images, CroÅ¿Å¿es, and Statues, without any moleÅ¿tation, or endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to deÅ¿troy them; or doing any other thing that may diÅ¿turb the publick Peace, upon pain of Death, without any hope of Mercy.

That all Seditious PerÅ¿ons, of what Religion Å¿oever they were, Å¿hould be Å¿everely puniÅ¿hed, and all Å¿hould be bound to diÅ¿cover and deliver them up to JuÅ¿tice, a thouÅ¿and Crowns being impoÅ¿ed upon any perÅ¿on who Å¿hould receive, abet, or conceal, Å¿uch Rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Offender, and the Offender to be whipp'd, if not able to pay the Penalty.

               <note place="margin">The Edict of <hi>January</hi> oppoÅ¿ed by the <hi>GuiÅ¿es</hi> and others.</note> who were now reconciled, and were abÅ¿ent at the time of making it, employed all their InduÅ¿try, to prevent its having its effect; alledging, it was not made as it ought, and would prove deÅ¿tructive to the Kingdome of <hi>France;</hi> and having brought over <hi>Navar</hi> to their Party, tho' they foreÅ¿aw they Å¿hould meet with great, and almoÅ¿t inÅ¿uperable, Difficulties; yet, they thought, they Å¿hould at laÅ¿t gain their Ends. The Duke of <hi>GuiÅ¿e</hi> went therefore to his Country HouÅ¿e, and his Brother <hi>Charles,</hi> the Cardinal, Å¿oon after followed him thither: So they both went to <hi>Zaberen,</hi> a Town belonging to the BiÅ¿hop of <hi>Strasburg,</hi> where <hi>ChriÅ¿topher,</hi> Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> met him, on pretence he came to viÅ¿it a Lady that was his KinÅ¿woman, bringing with him <hi>John Brent,</hi> and <hi>James Andrea,</hi> two eager defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the <hi>AuguÅ¿tane</hi> ConfeÅ¿Å¿ion againÅ¿t the <hi>Zuinglians,</hi> (whoÅ¿e Doctrine was generally followed by the ProteÅ¿tants in <hi>France;</hi>) here they conferred together three days.

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:51585:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>it, becauÅ¿e they did not Å¿o much deÅ¿ire the Reformation of Religion, and of the Church DiÅ¿cipline, as the Å¿preading lewd and monÅ¿trous Opinions, which tended to the filling <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> with new Tumults. That the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> wiÅ¿ely foreÅ¿aw this, who congratulating, by his AmbaÅ¿Å¿ador, the attempt, to reform the Church, expreÅ¿Å¿ed at the Å¿ame time his fear, that they Å¿hould embrace the <hi>Zuinglian</hi> and <hi>Geneva</hi> ConfeÅ¿Å¿ion, inÅ¿tead of the <hi>AuguÅ¿tane;</hi> and thereupon carefully adviÅ¿ed the King of <hi>Navar,</hi> to conÅ¿ider this. That the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> and the other Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> ought to fear the Å¿ame thing, if they deÅ¿ired the Peace of <hi>Germany,</hi> or that of the Church: For that as <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>France</hi> were near each other, Å¿o their IntereÅ¿ts were Å¿o interwoven, that the Good or Evil would be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to them. That as they were derived from one of the IlluÅ¿trious Families of <hi>Germany,</hi> and enjoyed one of the principal Stations in <hi>France;</hi> Å¿o they had left that Kingdom to confer with him (the Duke of <hi>Wirtemburg),</hi> and to Å¿ettle, by mutual ConÅ¿ent, what might be uÅ¿eful and Å¿alutary to both theÅ¿e States, and that they might conjointly oppoÅ¿e the Endeavours of the <hi>Zuinglians,</hi> and their Doctrine. They pretended, they did not do this, with intention to hinder the Reformation of Religion, and the WorÅ¿hip of God, <hi>For that they deÅ¿ired above all things;</hi> but that they Å¿ought to prevent that TempeÅ¿t, which theÅ¿e Sectaries were raiÅ¿ing, both in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany:</hi> And therefore, they deÅ¿ired the Duke, to interpoÅ¿e his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority with the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> and to induce them to have a good Opinion of their DeÅ¿igns.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Wirtemburg</hi> (having conÅ¿ulted with <hi>Brent</hi> and <hi>Andrea,</hi> his two Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, who were very deÅ¿irous, the <hi>Helvetian ConfeÅ¿Å¿ion</hi> Å¿hould not be entertained in <hi>France</hi>) commended the Cardinals affections towards himÅ¿elf and the Empire; and Å¿aid, he approved of his CounÅ¿el, for the hindering the Reception of that ConfeÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion in <hi>France,</hi> which, without doubt, would cauÅ¿e great Commotions.

As he went, he heard a Bell ring at an unuÅ¿ual time, and asking the reaÅ¿on of it, was told, It was to call the <hi>ProteÅ¿tants</hi> to their Meeting. Hereupon, his Foot-men began to make a NoiÅ¿e, as if there had been a Military Enterprize; but the Duke went on, and entred <hi>VaÅ¿Å¿y,</hi> where there were 60 HorÅ¿e ready to receive him, and he was to dine that day at <hi>Sclaron.</hi> The <hi>Curate</hi> and <hi>Prior</hi> were very earneÅ¿t with him, to go by the Conventicle; but whilÅ¿t he delayed them, and Å¿eemed unwilling to do it, the meaner part of his Attendants ran thither, and began to call the <hi>ProteÅ¿tants,</hi> who were there aÅ¿Å¿embled,

               </note> When the Pope heard of this Victory, he was Å¿trangely joyed at it, conceiving, this one Battel would put an end to the Power of the <hi>ProteÅ¿tants</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> he expecting that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect from Force and Violence, which the <hi>French</hi> hoped for only from a Council.

               <hi>Coligni</hi> entering <hi>Berry,</hi> led his Army to <hi>Ceel,</hi> the Å¿econd of <hi>January,</hi> a place, which the PrieÅ¿ts of that Province had choÅ¿en, to Å¿ecure the Church TreaÅ¿ures in,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:51585:42"/>which now, to their great damage, they perÅ¿uaded the TownÅ¿men to defend, it being Å¿oon taken, and all that Plate melted down, and the Inhabitants very Å¿everely uÅ¿ed for their ReÅ¿iÅ¿tance, and Å¿everal of them hanged, the PrieÅ¿ts eÅ¿caping in the Tumult. In <hi>BeauÅ¿Å¿e,</hi> the Duke of <hi>GuiÅ¿e</hi> took <hi>EÅ¿tampes,</hi> after which, he beÅ¿ieged <hi>Pluviers</hi> with 800 HorÅ¿e, who took the Suburbs; the GariÅ¿on of which, Å¿allying out, retired to <hi>Orleans,</hi> leaving their Carriages behind them. WhilÅ¿t the Duke of <hi>GuiÅ¿e</hi> was buÅ¿ie in preparing NeceÅ¿Å¿aries for the Siege of this great City, <hi>Andelot,</hi> who had undertaken the Defence of it, was as intent in fortifying and Å¿toring the City with all things that were neceÅ¿Å¿ary. There were in it 14 Companies of <hi>Germans,</hi> and 4 of TownÅ¿men, and many of the Nobility, all well Armed.</p>
            <p>The Queen,
<note place="margin">The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> carried to <hi>Blois.</hi>
               </note> when Å¿he had Å¿tayed a while at <hi>Chartres,</hi> went with the King to <hi>Blois,</hi> (as is Å¿aid) carrying with them the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> under a Å¿trong Guard; from whence, Å¿he Å¿ent him to the CaÅ¿tle of <hi>Onzain,</hi> a Å¿trong place in <hi>AngoumoiÅ¿e. Coligni</hi> was, in the mean time, wholly intent on the appeaÅ¿ing of the <hi>Germans,</hi> fearing they would mutiny for their Pay, which, he Å¿aid, would be Å¿ent in a Å¿hort time from <hi>England;</hi> Å¿o that, at laÅ¿t, he obliged them to promiÅ¿e, they would not deÅ¿ert him. The Duke of <hi>GuiÅ¿e,</hi> having quitted <hi>BeauÅ¿Å¿e,</hi> was by this time come to <hi>Baugy,</hi> where there were Å¿ome SkirmiÅ¿hes of no great conÅ¿equence between him and the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tants. Some mention was made alÅ¿o of a Peace, the PrinceÅ¿s of <hi>Conde</hi> propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ing, That her Husband, and <hi>Montmorancy,</hi> Å¿hould be Å¿et at liberty to that end, but there was nothing done in it. The Sieur <hi>Boucart,</hi> a Commander under <hi>Coligni,</hi> was coming before, <hi>Trimoville,</hi> a Town upon the <hi>Loire,</hi> which was under one <hi>Potin,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it to Å¿urrender; which being refuÅ¿ed, he took it by force, and put the Inhabitants to the Sword; amongÅ¿t whom, were 36 PrieÅ¿ts: From whence, he went to <hi>Gien,</hi> which was preÅ¿erved out of his hands by three Companies of <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who were Å¿ent thither for the approaching Siege of <hi>Orleans. Coligni,</hi> in the mean time, left <hi>Gergeau,</hi> and went to <hi>Orleans,</hi> to conÅ¿ult with the other Commanders what was beÅ¿t to be done, and there it was reÅ¿olved, the <hi>Germans</hi> Å¿hould be Å¿ent into <hi>Normandy,</hi> to be ready to receive their Pay out of <hi>England,</hi> which their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders readily accepted; <hi>Coligni</hi> went with them, and <hi>Gramont</hi> undertook the defence of <hi>Orleans, Andelot</hi> being Å¿ick. <hi>Coligni</hi> was all the way plied with MeÅ¿Å¿ages from the Queen, for a Peace, to hinder his Journey: The firÅ¿t of <hi>February,</hi> he arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with 4000 HorÅ¿e at <hi>Trcon,</hi> and took a view of the place, in which the late Battel was fought, from thence he went to <hi>Eureux:</hi> He took Å¿oon after St. <hi>Pere de Melun,</hi> a rich MonaÅ¿tery, and finding great Riches in its Church, which had been given by the Sea-men, he took its Wealth, and, which was worÅ¿e reÅ¿ented, deÅ¿troyed thoÅ¿e Images which were moÅ¿t addreÅ¿Å¿ed to in DiÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿es. Soon after, eight <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> Ships came to <hi>Havre de Grace,</hi> in which, were five <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> Companies, eight Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, great quantities of Ammunition and Money; whereupon he reÅ¿olved to take the CaÅ¿tle of <hi>Caen,</hi> before he went back to <hi>Orleans,</hi> and, the firÅ¿t of <hi>March,</hi> raiÅ¿ed a Battery of four Cannon againÅ¿t it, and took it in a few days, tho' the Duke of <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boeuf</hi> was Commander of it, who muÅ¿t have been taken too, but that <hi>Coligni</hi> was in haÅ¿t to relieve <hi>Orleans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>GuiÅ¿e</hi> began the Siege of <hi>Orleans</hi> the 7th of <hi>February,</hi>

               </note> and attack'd the Suburb de <hi>Olivet,</hi> which <hi>Andelot</hi> had ordered to be deÅ¿erted; but, by the negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the <hi>Germans,</hi> had like the next day to have proved the loÅ¿s of the City, <hi>GuiÅ¿e</hi> his Forces getting into it, before the <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>French</hi> could withdraw, and fire the HouÅ¿es; many of them periÅ¿hed in the Crowd, at the paÅ¿Å¿age of the Bridge which led to the City, and was then imbaraÅ¿Å¿ed with the Goods the <hi>Germans</hi> had heaped up there: But <hi>Andelot</hi> making a Å¿harp Sally at the Head of a Troop of Gentlemen, opened the way, and kept off the Enemy; it's Å¿aid however, 800 of the BeÅ¿ieged periÅ¿hed in this Tumult; others Å¿ay, not half the number: But yet, however, it was a great loÅ¿s, and much incommoded the City. Two days after, the other Suburbs were taken. The 18th of <hi>February,</hi> the Duke of <hi>GuiÅ¿e</hi> wrote to the Queen, That the Siege was very forward, and that, in a few days, he Å¿hould Å¿end her the joyful News it was taken; but the Å¿ame day, towards night, as he was riding with Å¿ome Officers,
<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>GuiÅ¿e</hi> wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by one <hi>Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trot.</hi>
               </note> he was Å¿hot in the Side by one <hi>John Poltrot,</hi> near his Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit. This perÅ¿on was a Gentleman of <hi>EngouleÅ¿me,</hi> and brought up as Page in the Family of <hi>Francis Boucart</hi> Baron <hi>d' Aubeterre,</hi> and having in his Childhood lived in <hi>Spain,</hi> could imitate that Nation to a wonder, and was commonly called, <hi>The Little Spaniard,</hi> he had long Å¿ince reÅ¿olved to be the death of this great Man, and had foretold it publickly, and was Å¿o much the leÅ¿s Å¿uÅ¿pected, becauÅ¿e he was thought a cloÅ¿e diÅ¿Å¿embling Fellow. Being Å¿ent by his MaÅ¿ter to learn an Account
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:51585:42"/>of the Battel of <hi>Dreux,</hi> he found <hi>Coligni</hi> at the Siege of <hi>Ceel,</hi> who gave him Money to buy a fleet HorÅ¿e; after which he never returned to his Lord, and this made <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligni</hi> Å¿uÅ¿pected, as conÅ¿cious of the DeÅ¿ign. From thence he went to the Duke of <hi>GuiÅ¿e</hi> his Quarters, and contracted an Acquaintance with his Servants, and this day after a Prayer to God to direct him, lying in wait, Shot him as he was returning home in the Evening. <hi>Poltrot</hi> fled into the next Wood, and they who purÅ¿ued him could not find him; and when he had rode all night, and quite tired his HorÅ¿e, next morning he came to <hi>Pont Olivet</hi> by <hi>Orleans;</hi> which being unknown to him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thought by him to be very diÅ¿tant from the place he fled from, he laid him down to Å¿leep, and was taken upon Å¿uÅ¿picion by the Searchers, and being known, was brought to the Queen to St. <hi>Ilario,</hi> and Examined concerning the Fact, and by whoÅ¿e Procurement he did it. He Å¿aid, he had been twice Å¿olicited to it by <hi>Coligni,</hi> and had at laÅ¿t conÅ¿ented to it upon the perÅ¿waÅ¿ion of <hi>Beza</hi> and another MiniÅ¿ter, but he Å¿aid, the Prince of <hi>Conde, Andelot,</hi> and the <hi>Sieur de Soubieze</hi> knew nothing of it. He adviÅ¿ed the Queen to have a care of her Å¿elf too, becauÅ¿e the ProteÅ¿tants were ill affected to her Å¿ince the Battel of <hi>Dreux,</hi> and that <hi>MonpenÅ¿ier</hi> and <hi>SanÅ¿ac</hi> were alÅ¿o deÅ¿igned to be cut off: An Account of which ConfeÅ¿Å¿ion being Å¿ent to <hi>Cologni</hi> by a <hi>German</hi> PriÅ¿oner, the 12th of <hi>March</hi> he publiÅ¿hed a Paper in his own defence, in which he call'd God and Man to WitneÅ¿s, that he never Å¿aw nor knew <hi>Poltrot</hi> before the laÅ¿t <hi>January,</hi> and he had given him Money and employed him as a <hi>Spie</hi> in the Duke of <hi>GuiÅ¿e</hi> his Camp, That when he went into <hi>Normandy,</hi> he had given him 100 Crowns to acquaint <hi>Andelot</hi> with what paÅ¿Å¿ed there; and that all he had Å¿aid beÅ¿ides were lies and falÅ¿ehoods; That though he was not much concern'd for the death of the Duke of <hi>GuiÅ¿e,</hi> who was an Enemy to the King, and to the Reformation, and all that Embraced it, yet he ever deteÅ¿ted theÅ¿e ways of Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and had never by himÅ¿elf or any other asked any Å¿uch thing of <hi>Poltrot,</hi> though he had before this diÅ¿covered, and could prove Å¿uch deÅ¿igns were entred into againÅ¿t <hi>Conde, Andelot,</hi> and himÅ¿elf, before the Queen and <hi>Montmorancy,</hi> to whom he had produced good AÅ¿Å¿urances of it. <hi>Beza</hi> alÅ¿o in the Å¿ame Paper, Å¿aid, he never Å¿aw <hi>Poltrot</hi> in all his Life; and <hi>Rochefocault</hi> Å¿aid the Å¿ame. <hi>Coligni</hi> Å¿ent the Å¿ame day a Letter to the Queen to intreat her to keep <hi>Poltrot,</hi> that the truth of his innocence might be made out from him, before he were Executed.
<note place="margin">The Death and Character of the Duke of <hi>GuiÅ¿e.</hi>
               </note> The Duke of <hi>GuiÅ¿e</hi> in the mean time died the 24th of <hi>February,</hi> having purged himÅ¿elf of the MaÅ¿Å¿acre of <hi>VaÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ay,</hi> and AdviÅ¿ed the Queen to make a Peace as Å¿oon as was poÅ¿Å¿ible. He was a Great Man in the Opinion of his Enemies, a good Soldier, and both fortunate and prudent in his Actions, but falling into a divided Factious State, he was by his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Charles,</hi> a violent Man, miÅ¿led, though he often deteÅ¿ted his AdviÅ¿es. Though he had no Command in the Battel of <hi>Dreux,</hi> yet he alone procured the Victory, this made him the Å¿ole General, and being terrible to the ProteÅ¿tants, it haÅ¿tened his Ruine, but then it had ill ConÅ¿equences (though at firÅ¿t it occaÅ¿ioned a Å¿peedy Peace) in after times. The Children of the Duke growing up in the Civil Wars which followed, inherited the popularity of their Father, and under the Pretences of Religion, and the Sloath of the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> endeavoured firÅ¿t to Revenge their Fathers Death on the ProteÅ¿tants, and at laÅ¿t turned their Arms againÅ¿t the Royal Family, to the great hazard of its Ruine and their own too.</p>
            <p>Soon after the Duke of <hi>GuiÅ¿e</hi> was wounded, the Queen Å¿ent <hi>Henry de Cloet,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Queen earneÅ¿tly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ires a Peace.</note> and the BiÅ¿hop of <hi>Limoges,</hi> to the PrinceÅ¿s of <hi>Conde</hi> and <hi>Andelot,</hi> to treat of a Peace Å¿everal times. And when he was dead, Å¿he yet more earneÅ¿tly deÅ¿ired it, fearing <hi>Conde</hi> and <hi>Montmorancy,</hi> the Heads of the two Parties. Or, as <hi>Davila</hi> Å¿aith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deÅ¿irous to drive out the Foreign Forces before they could Å¿ettle themÅ¿elves, and above all, the <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> out of <hi>Havre de Grace.</hi> BeÅ¿ides Å¿he wanted a General to Head the Kings Forces, <hi>Montmorency</hi> being then a PriÅ¿oner, and none of the reÅ¿t being equal to the Prince of <hi>Conde, Coligni,</hi> or <hi>Andelot;</hi> beÅ¿ides, the Royal Revenues were by the War reduced to Å¿o low an Ebb, that they were forced to borrow of their Neighbours to Å¿upport the War. In the mean time <hi>Francis de Briqueville Baron de Columbiers</hi> was employed by <hi>Coligni</hi> to take <hi>Bayeux,</hi> before which he came the 12th of <hi>February,</hi> and though at firÅ¿t repulÅ¿ed, yet upon the bringing four Cannon from <hi>Caen,</hi> he took the City the Fourth of <hi>March,</hi> the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿on helping him to plunder it, and many of the Inhabitants, eÅ¿pecially of the Clergy, were Å¿lain, becauÅ¿e they were thought to have occaÅ¿ion'd the reÅ¿iÅ¿tance which was made. Soon after St. <hi>Lo</hi> was deÅ¿erted, and fell into the hands of the ProteÅ¿tants, and after it <hi>Auranches. Vire</hi> had expell'd the ProteÅ¿tants, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to defend it Å¿elf, but was taken by Storm towards Night, which increaÅ¿ed the Calamities of the Inhabitants. <hi>Honfleur</hi> was taken by <hi>De Mouy,</hi> the Fourteenth
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:51585:43"/>of <hi>March.</hi> About this time <hi>Coligni</hi> having made <hi>Montgomery</hi> Governor of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi> went from <hi>Caen</hi> with a gallant Army towards <hi>LiÅ¿ieux,</hi> where he was excluded by the GariÅ¿on, and from thence to <hi>Bernay,</hi> which preÅ¿uming to do Å¿o too, he took the Town and made a great Å¿laughter of the Inhabitants, deÅ¿troying all their Images and Altars, and handling their PrieÅ¿ts very Å¿everely. The 7th of <hi>March</hi> the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> and <hi>Montmorancy</hi> were brought to the IÅ¿land <hi>Boaria</hi> near <hi>Orleans</hi> under Å¿trong Guards,
<note place="margin">The Treaty of Peace between the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> and <hi>Montmorancy.</hi>
               </note> and a Treaty of Peace was opened: And <hi>Montmorancy</hi> declaring he would never conÅ¿ent to the Edict of <hi>January,</hi> other Conditions were propoÅ¿ed, to the great diÅ¿Å¿atisfaction of the ProteÅ¿tants. <hi>Conde,</hi> upon his promiÅ¿e, had leave given him to enter <hi>Orleans,</hi> where he treated with the ProteÅ¿tant MiniÅ¿ters, but finding them reÅ¿olved to Å¿tand to the Edict of <hi>January,</hi> the 12th of <hi>March</hi> he came to an Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the Queen, which was Å¿ubÅ¿cribed by the King the 19th of the Å¿ame Month. The Terms of which were,
<note place="margin">The Articles agreed on.</note> That, 1. All the Nobility Å¿hould permit what Religion they pleaÅ¿ed, who had Sovereign Authority, in their JuriÅ¿dictions. That all Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Å¿hould have the free ExerciÅ¿e of Religion in their Families, if they did not live in Corporate Towns. That in every Generalite or Prefecture one City Å¿hould be aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿igned for thoÅ¿e of the Religion. And, that wherever they had at this day a Liberty, they Å¿hould Å¿till enjoy it. All Offences were remitted, and the Royal Moneys Å¿pent in the War; and <hi>Conde</hi> was acknowledged the Kings faithful and Loyal KinÅ¿man; and the Nobility, Captains, and all others who had aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿ted him, were pronounced to have done all things for the Kings Service, and with a good Intention.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Coligni</hi> was kept in <hi>Normandy</hi> by the Flattering ProÅ¿perity of his Arms,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Coligni</hi> not pleaÅ¿ed with the Peace.</note> and though he was, by many Letters from the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> preÅ¿Å¿ed to haÅ¿ten his Journey to <hi>Orleans,</hi> yet he did not arrive there before the 23 of <hi>March.</hi> The next day he could not diÅ¿Å¿emble his diÅ¿content at the Terms of the Treaty of Peace, telling the Prince publickly, <hi>That he wondered, how they could be prevailed upon to clap up a Peace upon Å¿uch diÅ¿advantageous Conditions, when the Affairs of the ProteÅ¿tants were in Å¿o flouriÅ¿hing a Å¿tate. That they ought to have remembred, that in the beginning of the War, the</hi> Triumvirate <hi>had conÅ¿ented, that the Edict of</hi> January <hi>Å¿hould be reÅ¿tored, and that now two of them</hi> (the King of <hi>Navar</hi> and the Duke of <hi>GuiÅ¿e</hi>) <hi>were Å¿lain, and</hi> Montmorancy <hi>was their PriÅ¿oner, and conÅ¿equently a Security for the Prince of</hi> Conde; <hi>Why Å¿hould not they have had the Å¿ame Terms? That the reÅ¿traint of the ProfeÅ¿Å¿ion of the ProteÅ¿tant Religion to one place in a Province, was to give up that by a daÅ¿h of the Pen, which their Sword could never have obtained. That what was granted to the Nobility could not be denied; and they would Å¿oon Å¿ee it was Å¿afer to Å¿erve God in the Suburbs of great Cities, than in their Private Families; and that it was uncertain whether their Children would be at all like them.</hi> But however nothing could reÅ¿cind an Agreement made by common conÅ¿ent. Thus ended the firÅ¿t Civil War of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have tranÅ¿cribed this whole Account of the firÅ¿t Civil War of <hi>France</hi> from the great <hi>Thuanus,</hi> abridging it as much as was poÅ¿Å¿ible, and purÅ¿uing the Actions only of the great Armies; becauÅ¿e if I had taken in all he relates of the various Actions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Parties in the Å¿everal great Cities and Provinces, it would have Å¿well'd infinitely beyond the deÅ¿ign of this Work, or otherwiÅ¿e have been Å¿o dark as not to be eaÅ¿ily intelligible. And if the Reader compare this Å¿hort Account with that given by <hi>Davila,</hi> he will Å¿oon Å¿ee, how little the Å¿incerity of that HiÅ¿torian is to be relied on, and how Å¿mall the ReaÅ¿on is, for him to treat the <hi>Huguenots</hi> as Rebels in all the CourÅ¿e of this War.</p>
            <p>When the War firÅ¿t began, the ProteÅ¿tants acted purely on the defenÅ¿ive, but after Å¿everal local MaÅ¿Å¿acres, they began to pull down Images and Altars in Revenge, for the blood-Å¿hed of the other Party, and finding, to their coÅ¿t, this did but enrage the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks againÅ¿t them, and made them the more cruel, they fell next upon the <hi>PrieÅ¿ts</hi> and <hi>Monks,</hi> as the Authors of their Calamities, this more incenÅ¿ing the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks; And they again uÅ¿ing the moÅ¿t horrid barbarities that were ever practiÅ¿ed by Men, the ProteÅ¿tants roÅ¿e likewiÅ¿e in their Executions on them; Å¿o that if this War had continued a few years, <hi>France</hi> muÅ¿t have been depopulated. Now though in all this the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks were the firÅ¿t AgreÅ¿Å¿ors, and forced the ProteÅ¿tants to this Å¿everity in their own defence, yet their Writers cunningly omitting the Provocation, or Å¿ofting the Actions of their own Party, Å¿et forth at large the Cruelties of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, (as they call them) and many times aggravate them above what is true; but <hi>Thuanus,</hi> though a <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick, was too great a Man to be guilty of Å¿o falÅ¿e a repreÅ¿entation, and who ever pleaÅ¿eth to conÅ¿ult him, will find, I have been very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks in this AbÅ¿tract, and have not Å¿ought occaÅ¿ions to make them odious without cauÅ¿e.</p>

<note place="margin">The Cardinal of <hi>Ferrara</hi> leaves <hi>France.</hi>
               </note> the Cardinal of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> the Pope's Legate in <hi>France</hi> after the Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Edict of <hi>January,</hi> Å¿eeing all things there in the Å¿tate he deÅ¿ired, he took his leave of the King and returned into <hi>Italy.</hi> Before he went, however, he took care to furniÅ¿h the King with Money to carry on the Siege of <hi>Orleans,</hi> which he took up of the Bankers of <hi>Paris.</hi> He had raiÅ¿ed a vaÅ¿t Expectation of this Council in the minds of all thoÅ¿e who had yet any KindneÅ¿s left in their Hearts for the <hi>See of Rome;</hi> and the more, becauÅ¿e they thought the Edict of <hi>January</hi> which had cauÅ¿ed the War, would then fall of CourÅ¿e, it being made only by way of ProviÅ¿ion till a Council Å¿hould determine otherwiÅ¿e. As the Cardinal was in his Journey Fifty HorÅ¿emen came out of <hi>Orleans</hi> under the Command of one <hi>MonÅ¿ieur Dampier,</hi> and Å¿urprized all his Mules, HorÅ¿es, and TreaÅ¿ures, and when he Å¿ent a Trumpeter to demand them again, the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> made AnÅ¿wer, That this magnificent and warlike Equipage did not befit PaÅ¿tors and the SucceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ors of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> but rather Commanders and Generals of War who were in Arms for Religion. Yet if he pleaÅ¿ed to recal the 200000. Crowns which he had fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿hed
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:51585:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>the <hi>Triumvirate</hi> with to carry on the War againÅ¿t him, and the <hi>Italian</hi> Forces out of <hi>France,</hi> he would then reÅ¿tore all he had taken to his Eminence.</p>
            <p>The Council which was appointed to meet at <hi>EaÅ¿ter</hi> of the former Year, was delay'd to the beginning of this;
<note place="margin">The CauÅ¿es of the Delay of the Council.</note> the Pope putting it off, becauÅ¿e he was as much afraid of the <hi>SpaniÅ¿h</hi> BiÅ¿hops as of the <hi>French National Council.</hi> He had been ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿itated to grant great Contributions to King <hi>Philip</hi> to be levied upon his Clergy, and he thought the BiÅ¿hops would on that Å¿core come with exaÅ¿perated Minds to the Council; and all his Thoughts were bent on the keeping the Papal Power undiminiÅ¿hed, rather than on Å¿atisfying the juÅ¿t Compaints of the Nations. At laÅ¿t being forced by an unreÅ¿iÅ¿table neceÅ¿Å¿ity he Å¿ent <hi>Hercules Gonzaga,
<note place="margin">The Pope's Legates Å¿ent to <hi>Trent.</hi>
                  </note> Jerom Seripand,</hi> and <hi>StaniÅ¿laus HoÅ¿io</hi> out of his BoÅ¿om, to be his Legates at <hi>Trent.</hi> And not long after he added to them <hi>James Simoneta,</hi> and <hi>Mark Sitico</hi> BiÅ¿hop of <hi>Altem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi> in <hi>TranÅ¿ylvania,</hi> who had orders to open the Council again the Eighteenth of <hi>January</hi> 1562. <hi>That thoÅ¿e things might be therein treated of which the
<note n="*" place="margin">Proponentibus Legatis.</note> Legates Å¿hould propoÅ¿e, and in the Å¿ame Order, for the taking away the Calamities of theÅ¿e Times, the appeaÅ¿ing the ControverÅ¿ies of Religion, the ReÅ¿training deceitful Tongues, the Correcting the AbuÅ¿es of depraved Manners, and the obtaining a True and ChriÅ¿tian Peace, by Å¿uch means as the Holy Council Å¿hould approve of.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> Clergy inÅ¿iÅ¿ted, That mention Å¿hould be made of a <hi>Free and General Council</hi> to be call'd for the Quieting of their Differences, becauÅ¿e their ProteÅ¿tants would never Å¿ubmit to the Determinations of the former SeÅ¿Å¿ions. On the contrary, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿Å¿ed they would only continue the former Council; and therefore they uÅ¿ed a middle way, and decreed, <hi>A Council Å¿hould be Celebrated.</hi> The <hi>SpaniÅ¿h</hi> BiÅ¿hops were as much diÅ¿Å¿atisfied becauÅ¿e all the Power of propoÅ¿ing was given to the <hi>Legates,</hi> and taken from the other BiÅ¿hops, and complained of it to King <hi>Philip;</hi> who Ordered his <hi>AmbaÅ¿Å¿ador</hi> to treat the Pope about it, that the Council might be free. The Pope AnÅ¿wered the AmbaÅ¿Å¿ador, <hi>That he was not at leiÅ¿ure to diÅ¿pute about Ablative CaÅ¿es PoÅ¿itive, and the Genders of Words, and that he had Å¿omething elÅ¿e to do.</hi> And in private he Å¿poke of the Calamities and Dangers of <hi>France</hi> with the Å¿ame unconcernedneÅ¿s. For when one of the <hi>French</hi> Cardinals deplored the Danger the See of <hi>Rome</hi> was in of loÅ¿ing that Kingdom, he replied, <hi>What then? if as long as I am BiÅ¿hop of this City I Å¿hall not be forced to abate any thing of the GreatneÅ¿s of my Table, and the Magnificence of my Buildings.</hi> And when they inÅ¿iÅ¿ted to have the Manners of Men and the DiÅ¿cipline of the Church throughly Reform'd, he Å¿aid, <hi>In that Particular he would Å¿atisfie</hi> France <hi>to the full, and take Å¿uch Care in it, that they Å¿hould all of them Repent that they had mentioned a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Adding, <hi>That he foreÅ¿aw that the Kingdom would be divided on the account of Religion, but he did not value the loÅ¿s of it a Farthing.</hi> All which ExpreÅ¿Å¿ions Å¿aith <hi>Thuanus, Are in the Letters of the French AmbaÅ¿Å¿ador that was then at</hi> Rome, <hi>out of which I have faithfully TranÅ¿cribed them; and the Letters are now in my Hands.</hi> The HiÅ¿tory of this Council is Å¿o well deÅ¿cribed by <hi>Petro Soave Polano,</hi> a Venetian, which is in EngliÅ¿h, that I need the leÅ¿s inÅ¿iÅ¿t upon it; but I Å¿hall however remark Å¿ome few things from <hi>Thuanus</hi> and others, for the Enlarging or Confirming the Credit of that HiÅ¿tory, which is much cryed down by the Roman Catholicks; as certainly they have good ReaÅ¿on to be offended with that Author, who with Å¿o much Truth and Impartiality has diÅ¿covered the Artifices of that AÅ¿Å¿embly, for the keeping up the Grandeur of the <hi>Court of Rome,</hi> and the SuppreÅ¿Å¿ion and Baffling that Reformation, which the moÅ¿t Learned of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> then Å¿o much deÅ¿ired and panted after.</p>
            <p>The Second SeÅ¿Å¿ion was held the Twenty Å¿ixth of <hi>February,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Books taken into conÅ¿ideration.</note> in which a Decree paÅ¿s'd againÅ¿t Reading Books Å¿uÅ¿pected of HereÅ¿ie, and a Å¿afe Conduct and an Invitation was given to all that would come to the Council. Seventeen BiÅ¿hops were by Name appointed to bring in a Catalogue of Å¿uch Books as were intended or thought fit to be Prohibited. <hi>Polano</hi> obÅ¿erves, that they carried this Å¿o high as to <hi>deprive Men of that Knowledge which was neceÅ¿Å¿ary to defend them from the <g ref="char:V">Æ²</g>Å¿urpations of the Court of</hi> Rome, <hi>by which means its Authority was maintained and made Great. For the Books were Prohibited and Condemned, in which the Authority of Princes and Temporal Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giÅ¿trates is defended from the <g ref="char:V">Æ²</g>Å¿urpations of the Clergy; and of Councils and BiÅ¿hops from the <g ref="char:V">Æ²</g>Å¿urpations of the Court of</hi> Rome, <hi>in which their HypocriÅ¿ies or Tyrannies are manifeÅ¿ted, by which the People, under pretence of Religion are deceived. In Å¿umm, a better MyÅ¿tery was never found out than to uÅ¿e Religion to make Men inÅ¿enÅ¿ible.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever this may help to keep thoÅ¿e in their Church which they now have; it doth certainly by Experience render them very Contemptible to all others, and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:51585:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>unable to defend their Religion; which is eÅ¿pecially true of their Laity.</p>
            <p>The Fourth of <hi>March</hi> the buÅ¿ineÅ¿s of the Safe Conduct was diÅ¿patched in a Congregation;
<note place="margin">A debate whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther EpiÅ¿copa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and ReÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence are of Divine Right.</note> and a Debate was raiÅ¿ed and purÅ¿ued with great Heat by the SpaniÅ¿h BiÅ¿hops, <hi>That EpiÅ¿copacy was inÅ¿tituted by God without any Medium; and that ReÅ¿idence and their Pastoral Deligence, in feeding their Flock, was of</hi> Divine Right, <hi>which they deÅ¿ired might be Confirmed by the Decree of the Council.</hi> But becauÅ¿e this tended to the EÅ¿tabliÅ¿hing the Authority of the BiÅ¿hops, and the Abating that of the Pope, his HolineÅ¿s was much concern'd at it, and having conÅ¿ulted the Cardinals about it, they by common conÅ¿ent Delayed, and by ambiguous AnÅ¿wers deluded the Fathers at <hi>Trent,</hi> and at laÅ¿t totally baffled them in this Point. The Second SeÅ¿Å¿ion was appointed to be the Twelfth of <hi>April,</hi> which was then prorogued to the Fourth of <hi>June,</hi> and from thence to the Fifteenth of the Å¿ame Month. In the mean time the King of <hi>France</hi> Å¿ent <hi>Lewis de Sanct Gelais Sieur de LanÅ¿Å¿ac,
<note place="margin">The <hi>French</hi> AmbaÅ¿Å¿adors Arrival.</note> Arnold de Ferrier,</hi> PreÅ¿iders of <hi>Paris,</hi> and <hi>Guy du Faur Sieur de Pibrac,</hi> his AmbaÅ¿Å¿adors to the Council, who arrived at <hi>Trent</hi> the Nineteenth of <hi>May. LanÅ¿Å¿ac</hi> Å¿oon after wrote a Letter to give an Account of their being come to the French ReÅ¿ident at <hi>Rome,</hi> in which he Å¿aid he thought they ought in the firÅ¿t Place to take care that an Event contrary to their Expectation might not attend the Council; that the Pope Å¿hould Order his <hi>Legates</hi> to Å¿hew great patience to thoÅ¿e who Å¿pake, proceed Å¿lowly in all things, attend the Arrival of thoÅ¿e BiÅ¿hops who were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and allow a Liberty without condition to all that were to Vote or Speak, and not fall under the old Reproach of having <hi>the Holy GhoÅ¿t Å¿ent them from</hi> Rome <hi>in a Portmanteau;</hi> and laÅ¿tly, that they Å¿hould take care that what was Decreed at <hi>Trent</hi> to the Glory of God, Å¿hould not be malignantly Interpreted and Traduced; or, it may be, Corrupted at <hi>Rome</hi> by a Company of Idle Men: He deÅ¿ired therefore he would endeavour to obtain theÅ¿e things of the Pope, as he did; but the Pope took this Liberty very ill, and deÅ¿ired, That <hi>no Prejudice might be done to his Authority by the</hi> French <hi>BiÅ¿hops.</hi> Adding, That <hi>he reÅ¿erved the Reformation of the EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿tical DiÅ¿cipline, and of the Court of</hi> Rome <hi>to himÅ¿elf; and that he might with greater Convenience attend this and the TranÅ¿actions at</hi> Trent, <hi>he intended to go to</hi> Bononia. The pretence of this Journey was the Crowning of the Emperor in that City, who was Å¿aid to be coming thither for that purpoÅ¿e: But the reality was, the Pope was afraid the World Å¿hould think him more Å¿olicitous for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ervation of the Papal Power, than for his PaÅ¿toral Cure.
<note place="margin">The Demands of the <hi>French</hi> AmbaÅ¿Å¿adors in the Council.</note> The Twentieth of <hi>May</hi> the <hi>French</hi> AmbaÅ¿Å¿adors were admitted in a Congregation, where they made an unacceptable Oration, an abÅ¿tract of which is in <hi>Polano: Thuanus</hi> Å¿aith, The Speech was made the Fourth of <hi>June,</hi> and that amongÅ¿t other things they deÅ¿ired, That the MiÅ¿Å¿als and Breviaries might be Reformed, and the Lectures which were not taken out of the Holy Scriptures might be cut off; That the Sacrament of the Lords Supper might be allowed in both <hi>Kinds</hi> according to the deÅ¿ire of many Nations; And alÅ¿o the Liberty of eating FleÅ¿h, and that the Severity of their FaÅ¿ts might be abated; That Marriage Å¿hould be allowed to the Clergy of Å¿ome Countries; That the multitude of Humane ConÅ¿titutions Å¿hould be retrenched, and Prayers in the Vulgar Tongue faithfully TranÅ¿lated, mixed with the Latin Hymns. Before this the AmbaÅ¿Å¿ador of the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> had alÅ¿o demanded the giving of the Cup in the Lords Supper to the Laity as abÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceÅ¿Å¿ary for the PreÅ¿erving thoÅ¿e who had not yet Å¿eparated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves from the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but were much offended with this denial, and for the Recovery of thoÅ¿e who had left it. And according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there were about Fifty of the moÅ¿t Learned of the Fathers of the Council who were for granting it, and amongÅ¿t them <hi>Gonzaga</hi> PreÅ¿ident of the Council, though all his Collegues diÅ¿Å¿ented. But the <hi>SpaniÅ¿h</hi> BiÅ¿hops oppoÅ¿ed it, and others thought it was fit firÅ¿t to Å¿end Legates into <hi>Germany</hi> who Å¿hould Å¿ee and report it to the Council whether it were neceÅ¿Å¿ary, and how it might be done. This was debated in a Congregation the Twenty eighth of <hi>AuguÅ¿t;</hi> but in the Twenty Å¿econd SeÅ¿Å¿ion held the Seventeenth of <hi>September</hi> it was rejected, and all were Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matized, <hi>That did not allow the Church to have taken away the Cup from the Laity,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>upon juÅ¿t Grounds.</hi> When the <hi>Germans</hi> Å¿till inÅ¿iÅ¿ted that it might be granted again to Å¿ome People; the Council to free themÅ¿elves from their importunity, turned them over to the Pope, who according to his Prudence was to do what he thought UÅ¿eful and Salutary. Before this the Pope being preÅ¿s'd to Grant the <hi>Cup</hi> by the French AmbaÅ¿Å¿ador about a Year Å¿ince, had referred it to the Conclave of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, and they and he had referred it to the Council; and now the Council Å¿ends it back to the Pope. <hi>Oh the Å¿tupid Patience of theÅ¿e Men!</hi>

            <p>When <hi>LanÅ¿Å¿ac</hi> gave the King of <hi>France</hi> an Account of what had been done, he Å¿aid in his AnÅ¿wer, That he liked what had been done as yet at <hi>Trent;</hi> but could not but obÅ¿erve that they went very Å¿lowly about the Reforming of the EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿tical DiÅ¿cipline,
<note place="margin">The <hi>French</hi> Kings Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions on the Proceedings of the Council.</note> and the Manners of the Clergy; and in the mean time were in great haÅ¿te to EÅ¿tabliÅ¿h the Points of Doctrine; That therefore it was Å¿u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pected when this was with Levity enough perform'd, there would be an end put to the Council, and no care be taken for the former, that Å¿o this procedure would afford no Benefit to the Church in this diÅ¿tracted State of ChriÅ¿tendom, and eÅ¿pecially to <hi>France.</hi> That about Thirty Years Å¿ince, when Fire and Sword had Å¿o unÅ¿ucceÅ¿sfully been imployed to Cure the DiÅ¿eaÅ¿e, all Men looked upon a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council as the Sheet-Anchor: That he wiÅ¿hed nothing had been done in the beginning of this Council for the Alienating the Minds of the Churches Enemies, but rather that they had by all means been allured, and invited to it; and if any had been prevail'd upon to come, that they Å¿hould have been treated by the Fathers of the Council with KindneÅ¿s and Humanity as Children. For to what end were all theÅ¿e careful and diligent DiÅ¿quiÅ¿itions and DiÅ¿putations concerning the Doctrine, Å¿eeing there was no debate but between the Catholick and ProteÅ¿tant in theÅ¿e Points? And as to the ProteÅ¿tants their Definitions Å¿ignified nothing, but only gave them OccaÅ¿ion to Å¿ay their Opinions were condemned by the Council without hearing what they had to Å¿ay for them: That therefore it Å¿eemed more adviÅ¿able to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to have brought them into the Council; for fear they Å¿hould in time withdraw all thoÅ¿e who adhere to the Church: For it was a vain furmiÅ¿e that the ProteÅ¿tants would ever Å¿ubmit to thoÅ¿e Decrees which were made when they were abÅ¿ent. That therefore he was of Opinion, That the Reforming the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Church-men, and the DiÅ¿cipline ought to be their firÅ¿t and greateÅ¿t Care, and the other to be for a time Å¿uÅ¿pended; for this would be acceptable to all Men. And laÅ¿tly, <hi>LanÅ¿Å¿ac</hi> was ordered to get the next SeÅ¿Å¿ion Prorogued to the latter end of <hi>October,</hi> 1563. that the <hi>French</hi> Clergy might be preÅ¿ent at it; or at leaÅ¿t that the publiÅ¿hing of the Canons might be deferred till then. When <hi>LanÅ¿Å¿ac</hi> had repreÅ¿ented all this to the Council, he deÅ¿ired in the King's Name, <hi>That Å¿eeing in the former SeÅ¿Å¿ions Å¿ome things had been decreed to the prejudice of the Liberties of the</hi> Gallicane Church, <hi>it being an ancient Privilege belonging to them to repreÅ¿ent by their Kings, or their AmbaÅ¿Å¿adors, what they thought uÅ¿eful or neceÅ¿Å¿ary for them, that this Liberty Å¿hould for the future be preÅ¿erved; and that if any thing were Acted to the contrary of it, it might be recalled.</hi> In the mean time, the Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>November,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Clergy arrive at <hi>Trent.</hi>
               </note> the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and about Forty of the <hi>French</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hops came to <hi>Trent</hi> with Å¿ome Divines, who were met without that City by the Pope's Legates, and Å¿ome of the other BiÅ¿hops, and of the AmbaÅ¿Å¿adors. In this Journey the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> went to <hi>Inspruck</hi> to meet the Emperor before he went to the <hi>Diet</hi> at <hi>Francfort</hi> where he had Å¿ome Conferences in private with that Prince about the Affairs of Religion.</p>
            <p>The Pope and the Cardinals at <hi>Rome</hi> were alarm'd at this coming of the <hi>French</hi> Clergy,
<note place="margin">The Pope al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm'd at it, as if Å¿o many Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded him.</note> as if Å¿o many Enemies had invaded them, and all things were in an Hurry to make Preparations againÅ¿t them. There were new Legates, and a new Squadron of <hi>Italian</hi> BiÅ¿hops, who might out number the <hi>French,</hi> preÅ¿ently to be Å¿ent to <hi>Trent.</hi> And the Pope wrote to King <hi>Philip</hi> to Order the BiÅ¿hops of his Dominions to unite their CounÅ¿els and Votes with the <hi>Italian</hi> BiÅ¿hops, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ReaÅ¿ons nor the Votes of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Æ²</g>ltramontane</hi> BiÅ¿hops might prevail againÅ¿t them. And in his private Audience with <hi>L' IÅ¿le</hi> the <hi>French</hi> ReÅ¿ident at <hi>Rome,</hi> he ridicul'd the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> by calling him, <hi>The other Pope who had Three hundred thouÅ¿and Pounds the Year Revenue, out of Å¿everal EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿tical Benefices, when he</hi> (good Man) <hi>was content with the Å¿ingle BiÅ¿hoprick of</hi> Rome; <hi>and it is an eaÅ¿ie thing</hi> (Å¿aith he) <hi>for the Cardinal with his belly full to praiÅ¿e FaÅ¿ting, and admoniÅ¿h others to be content with one Benefice.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> King had Å¿ent <hi>Francis de Bolliers, Sieur de Manes,</hi> to diÅ¿Å¿ipate and remove this JealouÅ¿ie of the Pope's, at the approach of the <hi>French</hi> BiÅ¿hops, and to acquaint his <hi>HolineÅ¿s</hi> with his Intentions. For that it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly Å¿aid, That the Cardinal was Å¿ent to get the TranÅ¿actions in the Conference of <hi>PoiÅ¿ey</hi> laÅ¿t Year confirm'd by the <hi>Synod,</hi> That the Cup might be granted to the Laity, That the Clergy might be allowed Matrimony, That the Liturgy might be in the Vulgar Tongue, That the BiÅ¿hops might have but one DioceÅ¿s, and that none Å¿hould be Elected to that Dignity who could not Preach to the People. As to the firÅ¿t <hi>Manes</hi> excuÅ¿ed the Conference of <hi>PoiÅ¿ey,</hi> and Å¿aid, It was appointed by the Queen and the Cardinal for the gaining time, and the retarding or keeping
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:51585:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>back thoÅ¿e inteÅ¿tine Commotions they foreÅ¿aw, and for the Å¿topping the Mouths of the Sectaries, who complained every where that their ReaÅ¿ons had never been heard; <hi>That they deÅ¿igned in the Interim to levy Forces Å¿o that if they could not convince the Sectaries by ReaÅ¿on, they might by force reduce them to their Duty.</hi> That nothing was done in that Conference. And as to the other Points the Cardinal and <hi>French</hi> Clergy had no other InÅ¿tructions than what had been Å¿ent to the AmbaÅ¿Å¿adors of <hi>France,</hi> and that they brought no prejudged Opinions with them to the Council. The Pope was much concern'd upon the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a Report that the BiÅ¿hops of <hi>France</hi> had moved their King to Å¿top the Payment of <hi>FirÅ¿t Fruits</hi> by the Clergy of <hi>France</hi> to the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> And he Å¿aid this was contrary to their Pacts and Agreements with him; which was, That this Affair Å¿hould be tranÅ¿acted with the Pope only in a friendly way. But then after all, nothing Å¿o much Å¿tartled the holy Man as a Report, that a Peace was treating Å¿ecretly with the ProteÅ¿tants, and that they would have Liberty given them to Preach and he foreÅ¿aw, that if <hi>France</hi> were once quieted, the Council could not be hurried to a ConcluÅ¿ion, but things would be well conÅ¿idered, and perhaps the ProteÅ¿tants muÅ¿t be heard in it, and amongÅ¿t them Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> which he feared beyond ExpreÅ¿Å¿ion.

I Å¿hall not here trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Reader with them. The 10th. of <hi>January</hi> the King of <hi>France</hi> ordered his AmbaÅ¿Å¿ador to aÅ¿Å¿ure the Pope that the <hi>Annals</hi> which were taken away in the AÅ¿Å¿em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the States of <hi>France,</hi> lately held at <hi>Orleans,</hi> Å¿hould for the future be paid to the Pope; he hoping by this means to have him more ready to grant his deÅ¿ires, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the peace of the Church, which the Pope's AmbaÅ¿Å¿ador largely promiÅ¿ed. On the 14th. of <hi>February</hi> a Decree was made concerning the ReÅ¿idence of BiÅ¿hops and PaÅ¿tors with great difficulty and oppoÅ¿ition, which all tended to the obtaining the Judgment of the Council, <hi>That the Pope has full power to feed, and govern the <g ref="char:V">Æ²</g>niver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿al Church.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> who hold that a Council is above the Pope, were contented to conceal their opinion in this point, for fear the Pope Å¿hould take that opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to diÅ¿Å¿olve the Council, without any good done by it. But then they were reÅ¿ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to defend their Å¿aid opinion if it were oppoÅ¿ed whatever happened, and upon no terms to loÅ¿e or yield it. King <hi>Philip</hi> alÅ¿o laboured very hard that the power of the BiÅ¿hops Å¿hould be raiÅ¿ed, and that of the Pope and the Conclave brought lower; which they of the Pope's party interpreted as a deÅ¿ign to diminiÅ¿h the <hi>SpaniÅ¿h</hi> Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, becauÅ¿e the BiÅ¿hops and Chapters of <hi>Spain</hi> would be more Å¿ubjected to the will of the King than the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> would. By which means they at laÅ¿t prevailed Å¿o far upon that jealous Nation, that the power of the BiÅ¿hops in the end was very much abated, and that of the Pope was enlarged and exalted; and the BiÅ¿hops were contented to act as the Popes Delegates, and by his Authority, and in his Name to exerciÅ¿e their Functions. About this time it was that the Cardinal of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi> went again to the Emperor to <hi>InÅ¿pruck,</hi> which cauÅ¿ed a great fear in the Pope's party in the Council, for that they Å¿uÅ¿pected he went to adjuÅ¿t with that Prince the ways to bring the Papal power under.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of <hi>March</hi> the Emperor wrote a Letter to the Pope (after he had conÅ¿ulted the BiÅ¿hops of <hi>Quinque EccleÅ¿iae,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Emperor diÅ¿likes the Proceedings of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.</note> who went to <hi>InÅ¿pruck</hi> to him) wherein he Å¿ignified to his HolineÅ¿s, <q>That after his Son in the laÅ¿t Diet was Elected King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and Crown'd, and that he had viÅ¿ited his Cities upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi> he was come to <hi>InÅ¿pruck</hi> to promote the Affairs of the Church in the Council as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the Supreme Advocate and Procurator of the Church; but that to his great grief he underÅ¿tood that things were Å¿o far from going as was to be deÅ¿ired, and as the publick State of Affairs required, that it was to be feared, if Å¿pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy remedies were not applied, the Council would be ended in Å¿uch manner, as it would give offence to all <hi>ChriÅ¿tendom,</hi> and become ridiculous to all thoÅ¿e who had made a defection from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and fix them more obÅ¿tinately in thoÅ¿e opinions they had embraced, tho' very differing from the Orthodox Faith. That there had not been any SeÅ¿Å¿ion celebrated for a long time, and that it was commonly given out, the Fathers and Doctors in the Council, had contentions and differences amongÅ¿t themÅ¿elves, which were unworthy of that moderation which they ought to have, and tended very much to the detriment of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord which was hoped for from them; and yet theÅ¿e conteÅ¿ts frequently broke out to the great Å¿atisfaction of their AdverÅ¿aries: That there was a report, That the Pope intended to diÅ¿Å¿olve or Å¿uÅ¿pend the Council; and he adviÅ¿ed him not to do it, becauÅ¿e nothing could be more Å¿hameful or damageable; and which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ides, would certainly cauÅ¿e a great defection from the Church, and bring a great hatred on the Papacy, and from thence cauÅ¿e an equal contempt of all the Clergy; That this diÅ¿Å¿olution or Å¿uÅ¿penÅ¿ion would certainly procure the AÅ¿Å¿embling of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Councils, which the Popes have ever oppoÅ¿ed as contrary to the Unity of the Church, and which thoÅ¿e Princes which were well affected to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> had hitherto hindred in their Dominions; but after this they could find no pretence to deny or delay them any longer. Therefore he deÅ¿ired the Pope to lay aÅ¿ide that thought, and to apply himÅ¿elf Å¿eriouÅ¿ly to the celebration of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, allowing the Ancient Liberty to all in its full extent, that all things might be diÅ¿patched rightly, lawfully, and in order, and thereby the mouths of their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿aries, who Å¿ought an opportunity to calumniate, might be Å¿topp'd. That it

               <note place="margin">The AmbaÅ¿Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of <hi>Spain</hi> received in the Council.</note> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in a Congregation; and there was a Speech made in the behalf of that Prince in the AÅ¿Å¿embly, by one <hi>Pedro Fontidonio de Segovia</hi> a Divine, who extoll'd above meaÅ¿ure the care of his MaÅ¿ter in the Affairs of Religion, and eÅ¿pecially his Å¿eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity Å¿hewn towards Sectaries; he Å¿aid this Prince Married <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> only to the end he might reÅ¿tore the Catholick Religion in that flouriÅ¿hing Kingdom. He Reproached the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>German</hi> Nations, for thinking that much was to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged to the Hereticks, that being won by theÅ¿e ConceÅ¿Å¿ions they might be reduced into the boÅ¿om of the Church. At laÅ¿t he Å¿aid, That they ought Å¿o to conÅ¿ult the Salvation of Hereticks, and the MajeÅ¿ty of the Church, that all things might be done for the promoting the latter, rather than for gratifying the former. And he exhorted all Princes to imitate the Å¿everity of his MaÅ¿ter in bridling Hereticks, that the Church might be delivered from Å¿o many MiÅ¿eries, and the Fathers of <hi>Trent</hi> from the care of celebrating Councils.</p>
            <p>A little before this time the news of the Peace made with the ProteÅ¿tants of <hi>France,</hi> came firÅ¿t in Generals, and Å¿oon after the particular Articles.
<note place="margin">The Fathers at <hi>Trent</hi> much diÅ¿Å¿atisfied with the Peace made in <hi>France.</hi>
               </note> This was <q>blamed by the greater part of the Fathers in that Council, who Å¿aid it was to prefer the things of the world before the things of God; yea to ruin both the one and the other. For the Foundation of a State, which is Religion, being removed, it is neceÅ¿Å¿ary that the Temporal Å¿hould come to deÅ¿olation; whereof the Edict made before was an example, which did not cauÅ¿e Peace and Tranquility, as was hoped, but a greater War than before.</q> The truth is, theÅ¿e men would have all the world fight out their quarrel to the laÅ¿t man, and then if their Catholicks periÅ¿h, they are as unconcerned as for the Hereticks; and accordingly ever Å¿ince that time they have made it their buÅ¿ineÅ¿s firÅ¿t to hinder all Treaties of Peace, wherein any li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty was granted to the ProteÅ¿tants; and when they could not gain that point, to make them be broken as Å¿oon as was poÅ¿Å¿ible; tho this too has for the moÅ¿t part turn'd in the end to their great loÅ¿s and Å¿hame.
<note place="margin">The <hi>French</hi> Court Å¿hew their ReaÅ¿ons for it.</note> The <hi>French</hi> Court perceiving how the Fathers of <hi>Trent</hi> took the Peace, Ordered the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> to Å¿hew the great Dangers which from the Civil War threatned that Kingdom; and to aÅ¿Å¿ure the Council that it was the intention of the King <hi>to diÅ¿Å¿ipate the Factions of</hi> France <hi>by a Peace, that he might be at leiÅ¿ure to attend Å¿eriouÅ¿ly the reÅ¿titution of the Peace of the Church.</hi> But when this would not be allowed <q>neither, the Queen Å¿ent <hi>Renate de Birague,</hi> PreÅ¿ident of <hi>Dauphine,</hi> to aÅ¿Å¿ure the Fathers, That their Intentions were not to Å¿ettle a New Religion in <hi>France,</hi> nor to Å¿uffer it to grow up and encreaÅ¿e, but that having diÅ¿armed their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and quieted the Tumults, they might with the leÅ¿s trouble return to the Methods uÅ¿ed by their AnceÅ¿tors, for the reducing their people into the way, and the Unity of the Å¿ame Catholick Religion. That this could never be done but by the Authority of a lawful and free, either General or National Council: that a General Council Å¿eemed the Å¿afer way, but then it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ary that a liberty and Å¿ecurity Å¿hould be given to all that would to come. That tho' this had been done by the Pope and the Fathers; yet the place was Å¿uch; and Å¿o Å¿ituate, that being rather in <hi>Italy</hi> than <hi>Germany,</hi> the ProteÅ¿tants could not think themÅ¿elves Å¿ufficiently Å¿ecure. For they deÅ¿ired a Council in <hi>Germany,</hi> and thought they were not Å¿afe if it were any where elÅ¿e: That not only they of <hi>Germany,</hi> but the <hi>EngliÅ¿h, Scotch, Danes</hi> and <hi>Swedes,</hi> were of the Å¿ame mind, and it was very unjuÅ¿t to condemn Å¿o many Nations unheard, and beÅ¿ides it was unprofitable too, for whereas all good men hoped that this Council would procure an Unity, on the contrary it would cauÅ¿e a greater op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ition and enmity, when theÅ¿e Nations Å¿aw themÅ¿elves neglected; and by the inconvenience of the place, as it were excluded out of the Council. For it was fit for none but weak and credulous men to think they would ever Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Decrees of a Council in which they had never been admitted, nor heard; but it was to be feared on the other Å¿ide that their minds being exaÅ¿perated, their patience would turn to fury, and they would traduce to PoÅ¿terity the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:51585:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>Decrees of the Council; and in the preÅ¿ent age treat them with a virulent Å¿harpneÅ¿s in their Writings.

For there are Laws, That no accuÅ¿ed perÅ¿on Å¿hall be cited out of the Limits of the JuriÅ¿diction in which he lives, and that the Citation Å¿hall not be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cure and perfunctory, but declared to the proper perÅ¿on, or to his family. And the ConÅ¿titution of Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the Eighth, That Citations Å¿et up in certain places of <hi>Rome</hi> Å¿hould be of force, was recall'd by <hi>Clement</hi> the Fifth, and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Venna,</hi> as hard and unjuÅ¿t, or at leaÅ¿t mitigated; and it was decreed that they Å¿hould not be uÅ¿ed, but when there was no Å¿afe coming to the perÅ¿on accuÅ¿ed: But in <hi>France,</hi> where the Queen of <hi>Navarr</hi> reÅ¿ides, it cannot be pretended that there is no Å¿afe coming to her. And what can be more contrary to Natural Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty than to condemn unheard? It is forbidden by the Canons and Decrees of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, and there is a noble example of this in <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus,</hi> where Pope <hi>Liberius,</hi> being urged by <hi>ConÅ¿tantius</hi> to condemn <hi>AthanaÅ¿ius,</hi> choÅ¿e rather to be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿hed, than to Å¿entence him without hearing. And in the Judgment againÅ¿t <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Third, who was accuÅ¿ed of InceÅ¿t, <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Emperor obÅ¿erved the Å¿ame method, and made him appear and anÅ¿wer in a <hi>Synod</hi> before Fifty BiÅ¿hops. For the Å¿ame reaÅ¿on the Sentence of <hi>Nicholas</hi> the FirÅ¿t, againÅ¿t <hi>Lotharius</hi> the Son of St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> for having two Wives, was thought void and null. Nor was this Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againÅ¿t the Queen of <hi>Navarr</hi> of better force, becauÅ¿e Å¿he was abÅ¿ent and unheard. That the Popes have always Å¿hewn that reÅ¿pect to Crown'd heads, as to admoniÅ¿h them by their Legates, before they decreed ought againÅ¿t them. So <hi>Alexander</hi> the Third Å¿ent two Cardinals to <hi>Henry</hi> the Second into <hi>England,</hi> when he was accuÅ¿ed of the Death of <hi>Thomas a Becket</hi> A.B. of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> That he might purge himÅ¿elf before them of this crime. So of late <hi>Clement</hi> the Seventh, did the like in the caÅ¿e of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, to whom he Å¿ent Cardinal <hi>Campeius.</hi> And if it were granted that the Judgment were rightly paÅ¿Å¿ed, how could the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions of the Queen be expoÅ¿ed for a prey, and given to the firÅ¿t Invader, they belonging to the King as Lord of the Fee? Therefore the King believes that the Pope is deceived by falÅ¿e reports, and inÅ¿tigated by the craft of his MiniÅ¿ters, who not regarding the publick peace, have drawn him from his natural goodneÅ¿s, to CounÅ¿els which are diÅ¿honourable to his HolineÅ¿s, and deÅ¿tructive to his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and to that of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> tending to the alienating of the hearts of his friends from him, and the diÅ¿turbing of the Peace of <hi>ChriÅ¿tendom.</hi> And his MajeÅ¿ty is the more perÅ¿waded of the truth of this, becauÅ¿e his HolineÅ¿s Å¿o ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿tly eÅ¿pouÅ¿ed the IntereÅ¿t of <hi>Anthony</hi> the Husband of this Queen in his life-time; and endeavoured to perÅ¿wade King <hi>Philip</hi> to reÅ¿tore to him the Kingdom of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varr,</hi> or at leaÅ¿t to give him the IÅ¿land of <hi>Sardinia</hi> as an <hi>Equivalent.</hi> But then there is nothing more offends the King than the conÅ¿idering that whereas Å¿o many Kings, Princes, and Free States above Forty years Å¿ince have defected from the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and committed the offence charged upon the Queen, and Å¿o by the rule of JuÅ¿tice ought to be firÅ¿t puniÅ¿hed as firÅ¿t offending; yet the Pope has
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:51585:48"/>not proceeded in the Å¿ame way, or with equal Å¿everity againÅ¿t any of them; Å¿o that from hence it is clear that an occaÅ¿ion is Å¿ought by her enemies to oppreÅ¿s and ruin her by Å¿urprize, whileÅ¿t Å¿he is a Widow, her Children Orphans, the King of <hi>France</hi> who ought to protect her being a Minor, and diÅ¿turbed by Civil Wars; and for this reaÅ¿on the King is the more obliged to defend her from injury, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf from contempt, Å¿eeing without acquainting him with it, they have begun this ProceÅ¿s againÅ¿t a Queen Å¿o nearly related to him. That if this AccuÅ¿ation had been made on the account of Religion, and for the Glory of God, the Pope ought in the firÅ¿t place to have Å¿hewn his care of her Å¿oul, and from the <hi>Word of God</hi> to have adminiÅ¿tred fitting Remedies, and not to have proÅ¿cribed her King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Dominions,
<note place="margin">The DepoÅ¿ing of Princes, and diÅ¿poÅ¿ing of their Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, the cauÅ¿e of great Calamities.</note> and given them for a prey to the firÅ¿t Invader. The Pope has a Supremacy given him, That he may conÅ¿ult the Salvation of Souls, and the repoÅ¿e of <hi>ChriÅ¿tendom,</hi> and not that he may deprive Princes of their Kingdoms, and diÅ¿poÅ¿e of their poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ions at his pleaÅ¿ure; which the former Popes have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been able to do in <hi>Germany</hi> and other places, without bringing great reproach and diÅ¿honour on the Church, and diÅ¿turbances upon the World. That therefore the King deÅ¿ired with the greateÅ¿t humility that he could or ought, that the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againÅ¿t the Q. of <hi>Navarr</hi> Å¿hould be revok'd, and all the Pope's MiniÅ¿ters Å¿hould be inhibited from proceeding in this cauÅ¿e by a publick Act; and if this were not done, the King Å¿hould be forced againÅ¿t his will to make uÅ¿e of the Å¿ame reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies his AnceÅ¿tors had imployed in the like caÅ¿es, according to the Laws and Rights of his Kingdom. But before all things he proteÅ¿ted he Å¿hould do this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly, and therefore they only Å¿hould bear the blame who by their raÅ¿hneÅ¿s had forced him to uÅ¿e the power God had given him, in Å¿o juÅ¿t a cauÅ¿e, and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance of his friends againÅ¿t them.</q>

            <p>There was at the Å¿ame time diÅ¿tinct Memorials, and larger InÅ¿tructions Å¿ent to the <hi>French</hi> AmbaÅ¿Å¿ador for the Defence of the BiÅ¿hops,

<note place="margin">The Pope gained the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> to his Å¿ide,</note> and was willing to Å¿acrifice the Å¿afety of <hi>France,</hi> and the King's Will, to the IntereÅ¿t of the former.

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:51585:48"/>Affairs of the Council, Å¿o if they Å¿till went on to cure the deÅ¿perate wounds of the Church with a light hand, or rather to plaÅ¿ter them over, and conceal, than cure them, whileÅ¿t they omitted the proper and moÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿ary remedies, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tead of conÅ¿idering the Reformation of the Church, turn'd the edge of their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority againÅ¿t the Power of Princes, and the Decrees of Councils, he would not have the PreÅ¿ence of his AmbaÅ¿Å¿adors add Authority to Å¿uch unjuÅ¿t Decrees to the great prejudice of his Royal Dignity, and to the Damage of the Liberties of his Kingdom. He Å¿aid alÅ¿o that he had been informed that the Council had enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a deÅ¿ign to declare the Marriage of <hi>Anthony de Bourbon</hi> King of <hi>Navarr,</hi> and <hi>Joan</hi> his Queen unlawful, and to declare <hi>Henry</hi> his Son a BaÅ¿tard; and he commanded them not to be preÅ¿ent at any Å¿uch Act. LaÅ¿tly, he commanded them to repeat their former demands; and if the Fathers of the Council would not grant them, then to leave <hi>Trent,</hi> and go to <hi>Venice,</hi> and Å¿tay there till they had further Orders from him. He told them alÅ¿o that his principal deÅ¿ire was by a Å¿erious Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Church-affairs and manners, (the corruptions in which had cauÅ¿ed Å¿o many to make defection from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) by the Authority of a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, to unite the divided minds of men in the matters of Religion. That his AmbaÅ¿Å¿adors and Proctors had often treated with the Pope, and the Fathers of the Council about this; and to that end had exhibited the Å¿aid XXXIV. Articles, to which no Å¿atisfactory return had been made, but on the contrary, they having lightly touched the buÅ¿ineÅ¿s of Reformation, had exerciÅ¿ed an Authority which belonged not to them, againÅ¿t the Rights,
<note place="margin">The Council has no Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over Princes.</note> Liberties and Power of Soveraign Princes. That they neither could nor ought to inquire into the Civil AdminiÅ¿tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was not Å¿ubject to their Court, nor to derogate from thoÅ¿e ConÅ¿titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and CuÅ¿toms which had been long enjoyed by Princes; nor to Anathematize Kings; all which things tended to Sedition, and the interruption of the publick Peace: That he would not Å¿uffer that Authority which he had received from his AnceÅ¿tors to be weakned by their unjuÅ¿t cenÅ¿ures. Yea, he commanded them to tell the Fathers, That if they preÅ¿umed any more to undermine the Authority of Kings, and the <hi>Prerogatives of their Betters,</hi> that they Å¿hould then alÅ¿o proteÅ¿t a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t their proceeding, and leave <hi>Trent:</hi> AdviÅ¿ing the BiÅ¿hops and Divines of <hi>France,</hi> who were in the Council to promote the Reformation of Religion as much as was poÅ¿Å¿ible for the good of his divided Kingdom, and to that end to Å¿tay Å¿till at <hi>Trent.</hi> But then the King did truÅ¿t to their wiÅ¿dom and conÅ¿cience, that they would not approve of by their preÅ¿ence, or conÅ¿ent to any thing which was preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to the Royal Authority, Prerogative or Dignity of the King or Kingdom of <hi>France.</hi>
               </q> But however the Council Å¿till perÅ¿iÅ¿ting in their former Methods, <hi>La Ferriere</hi> came into the Council, and made a Å¿harp Oration againÅ¿t the Pope and the Council. <hi>Polano</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 721.</note> in his HiÅ¿tory of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> has the Å¿um of this Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and <hi>Thuanus</hi> Å¿aith it was pronounced the 22d. of <hi>September.</hi> But however, I will not trouble the Reader with it here, becauÅ¿e of its great length; this Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion pleaÅ¿ed none of the Fathers; the <hi>French</hi> themÅ¿elves not excepted, becauÅ¿e he Å¿et Princes as the <hi>MiniÅ¿ters</hi> of God, above the <hi>Anathema's</hi> of the Clergy, and made both their perÅ¿ons and revenues Å¿ubject to the Laws and Authority of Kings; telling them too plainly of their great prevarications, obÅ¿tinacy and unwillingneÅ¿s to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, or be reformed.</p>
            <p>But however, all the Fathers could do, was to bring the Faith of the AmbaÅ¿Å¿adors in queÅ¿tion, which they Å¿oon diÅ¿cuÅ¿s'd by producing their InÅ¿tructions. This failing, they cavell'd at the parts of the Oration, and endeavoured to pervert the Å¿enÅ¿e and meaning of it; Å¿o that <hi>Ferriere</hi> was forced to publiÅ¿h an <hi>Apology</hi> for it. And Å¿oon after this they mended the matter by a Å¿harper Oration, in which amongÅ¿t other things they told the Council plainly,
<note place="margin">The AmbaÅ¿Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of <hi>France</hi> put a Å¿everet ProteÅ¿tation into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.</note> 
               <hi>That</hi> Hadrian <hi>the Sixth was in the right when he told the world, That what care Å¿oever was taken of the lower members of the Church, that body could not be reÅ¿tored to its health, if the Head alÅ¿o (the Pope) were not reformed.</hi> Towards the end they Å¿aid, <hi>They proteÅ¿ted only againÅ¿t</hi> Pius <hi>the Fourth; They Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated the ApoÅ¿tolick See, the great</hi> Pontiff, <hi>the Holy Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>for the increaÅ¿e of whoÅ¿e Dignity their AnceÅ¿tors had Å¿o often Å¿hed their blood, and of late had fought in</hi> France; <hi>but it was againÅ¿t the Soveraignty of</hi> Pius <hi>the Fourth, that they proteÅ¿ted; all whoÅ¿e Decrees and Sentences they refuÅ¿ed and deÅ¿piÅ¿ed; and Å¿eeing there was nothing done at</hi> Trent, <hi>but all was diÅ¿patched at</hi> Rome; <hi>and what was here publiÅ¿hed, was rather the Dictates of</hi> Pius <hi>the Fourth, than the Decrees of a General Council; they denounced and teÅ¿tified, That whatever was decreed in that Convention, or Å¿hould hereafter be decreed or publiÅ¿hed, they being only the Decrees moved by</hi> Pius <hi>the Fourth, they Å¿hould not be approved by the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:51585:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>Most ChriÅ¿tian King, nor the</hi> French, <hi>nor be taken for the Acts of a General Council. And then commanded all their ArchbiÅ¿hops, BiÅ¿hops, Abbots and Divines to return into</hi> France <hi>till God Å¿hould reÅ¿tore to the Catholick Church the ancient form and liberty belonging of right to General Councils, and to the MoÅ¿t ChriÅ¿tian King his juÅ¿t Rights. Thuanus</hi> Å¿aith, he can hardly believe this Oration was made, tho' he finds it Printed in the Commentaries of <hi>Jacques de Bourdin</hi> Secretary of State. But however it Å¿hews the Å¿enÅ¿e great men had of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> at that time when it was beÅ¿t under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tood.</p>
            <p>A little before this time the Emperor being about leaving <hi>InÅ¿pruck,</hi>

We may Å¿ee by this how hardly this Holy Council was kept from giving the world a CaÅ¿t of its of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in depoÅ¿ing Princes, and diÅ¿poÅ¿ing of their Dominions, and abÅ¿olving their Subjects from their Allegiance; tho' we are now told, this is none of the Doctrines of that Church; but however, it is undoubtedly her practice. This Admonition was Å¿o effectual that the Pope deÅ¿iÅ¿ted at <hi>Rome,</hi> and revoked the CommiÅ¿Å¿ion given to that purpoÅ¿e to the Legates at <hi>Trent.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>But then as to the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks of this Age, who would fain perÅ¿wade us that nothing was amiÅ¿s; that there was no need of any Reformation; that all the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences aroÅ¿e from miÅ¿repreÅ¿enting the Doctrines and Practices of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and that this Council was one of the moÅ¿t holy AÅ¿Å¿emblies of Learned, Impartial and Religious men that ever Å¿ate. TheÅ¿e I Å¿ay are a a pleaÅ¿ant parcel of Gentlemen, and preÅ¿ume that we are as ignorant of, and unconcern'd for the HiÅ¿tories of former times, as thoÅ¿e who profeÅ¿s to be led by an implicite faith in all they have the confidence to teach them; which is a great miÅ¿take.</p>
            <p>From this day forward the ProteÅ¿tants renounced all commerce and friendÅ¿hip with the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and Å¿he has by this Council put her Å¿elf out of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of a Reconciliation; Å¿o that now the Quarrel is put intirely into the hands of God, and all humane wiÅ¿dom is baffl'd for ever. Time, the Sword, or the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God may perhaps at laÅ¿t put an end to it, but no CounÅ¿el or Device of men ever Å¿hall.</p>
            <p>I Å¿hould here have ended this Continuation,
<note place="margin">The State of Religion in <hi>Piedmont.</hi>
               </note> but that I have been forced to leave Å¿ome things unÅ¿poken to continue the thread of my Relation, which I will now go back to and gather up, that the Story may be the more compleat and perfect. WhileÅ¿t the Council was Å¿itting, the Cardinal of <hi>Ferrara</hi> travelling through <hi>Piedmont</hi> and <hi>Savoy,</hi> found the Affairs of that Country as to Religion not much other than in <hi>France.</hi> In divers places of the <hi>MarquiÅ¿ate</hi> of <hi>Saluzza,</hi> all the PrieÅ¿ts were hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted away; and in <hi>Cherie</hi> and <hi>Cuni,</hi> places belonging to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and in many other Cities near unto them, many were of the Å¿ame opinions with the <hi>Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots,</hi> and many even in the Duke's Court alÅ¿o did profeÅ¿s them, and more were diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered every day. And however the Duke had Å¿et forth a Proclamation a Month before; <hi>That all that followed thoÅ¿e opinions Å¿hould within eight days depart out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> and Å¿ome did thereupon depart, yet afterwards he commanded there Å¿hould be no proceedings againÅ¿t them, and pardon'd many who were condemn'd by the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiÅ¿ition,</hi> and made their ProceÅ¿s void, as alÅ¿o thoÅ¿e who were in the <hi>InquiÅ¿ition,</hi> and not condemn'd; and gave leave to Å¿ome that were departed to return.</p>
            <p>About the Å¿ame time there hapned a great tumult, and popular commotion in <hi>Bavaria,</hi> becauÅ¿e the Cup was not allowed, nor Married men Å¿uffered to preach;
<note place="margin">A Tumult in <hi>Bavaria</hi> for the Cup.</note> which diÅ¿order proceeded Å¿o far, that to appeaÅ¿e them, the <hi>Duke</hi> promiÅ¿ed in the <hi>Diet,</hi> That if in all the Month of <hi>June</hi> a reÅ¿olution were not made in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> or by the Pope, to give them Å¿atisfaction, he himÅ¿elf would grant both the one and the other. The news of this coming to the Council, the Legates diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched <hi>Nicholas Ormonet</hi> to perÅ¿wade the Duke not to make that Grant.

The <hi>French</hi> thereupon (without ever reflecting on their own ConÅ¿piracy againÅ¿t the <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi>) began a loud complaint, That the <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> came not to protect the <hi>French</hi> in their diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿es, but to get the poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion of the Town, dealing with them not as with Brethren, but as Foreigners.

This Decree met with Å¿ome oppoÅ¿ition from the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> which pretends to be the Supreme Court of that Kingdom; and Å¿aid, they ought to have had the honour of declaring the King of Age, and no other, which was Å¿oon over-rul'd.</p>

How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever certain it is, Å¿ome of the ProteÅ¿tants made her an ill requital: For in <hi>AuguÅ¿t</hi> following, certain of the Queens Family remaining in the Palace of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> call'd <hi>Holy-Rood HouÅ¿e,</hi> and having a PrieÅ¿t to attend them, and perform the <hi>RomiÅ¿h</hi> Service in the Chapel, divers of the Inhabitants of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> out of curioÅ¿ity or devotion reÅ¿orting thither, great offence was taken at it, and the Preacher began to complain of it as a diÅ¿order. Whereupon Å¿ome of the Citizens went thither to Å¿ee if it were Å¿o; theÅ¿e being denied Admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, they forced the Gates of the Queens Palace; took Å¿everal of thoÅ¿e who were there aÅ¿Å¿embled and carried them to priÅ¿on; the PrieÅ¿t and Å¿ome few others eÅ¿ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping by a PoÅ¿tern, or Back-door.
