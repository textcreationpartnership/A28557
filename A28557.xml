            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>IT was the Misfortune of this Great Man, <hi>John Sleidan,</hi> to die in that nick of Time, when the Fates of the two contending Religions, and of all Chriſtendom, were juſt upon the ſetling: It is true,
<note place="margin">The Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> he lived to ſee the <hi>Auguſtane</hi> Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſetled in the Dyet of <hi>Ausburg,</hi> and perhaps he might hear of the Reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Empire by <hi>Charles</hi> V, to his Brother <hi>Ferdinand;</hi> but then Death ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized him before he could give any account of it; for with it he deſigned to have begun the next Book, in all probability, and to have filled up this with ſome other Accidents; ſuch as a large account of the Revolt of <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> and the Siege of <hi>Sigeth</hi> would have afforded him. But then had he lived till the Year 1563, he ſhould have ſeen the Death of Queen <hi>Mary, Henry</hi> II of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> V, and the ſetling of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Religion, by the Determination of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> contrary to the Expectation of all Men; which ſeems to be the firſt Period of the Reformation, and abſolutely neceſſary to give the Reader a clear Proſpect and full View of the firſt Joynt of this great Revolution. I have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore perſuaded the Stationer to add a Suppliment to this Verſion, for that purpoſe; and becauſe I am a Member of the Religion by Law eſtabliſhed, and not willing to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51585:3"/>offend them of the other Perſuaſions, I reſolve to advance nothing in it but from Authors, who lived and dyed in the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhewing the matter of Fact with great Brevity, and making few or no Reflections of my own: That ſo the Reader may be left entirely to himſelf, to think what he Pleaſe, and God ſhall direct him.</p>
            <p>I will begin with the Buſineſs of <hi>Tranſylvania: John</hi> the laſt King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> dyed of Joy for the birth of his Son,<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1556</label> in the Year 1539: His Son being left thus an Infant,
<note place="margin">The Revolt of <hi>Tranſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</hi>
               </note> his Mother the Queen Regent, put him under the Protection of <hi>Solyman,</hi> Emperour of the <hi>Turks,</hi> to ſecure him from the Violence of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> who claimed that Kingdom; and thereupon a ſharp War enſued, which ended in the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Intereſt, and the loſs of both thoſe Princes, the <hi>Turk</hi> taking <hi>Quinque Eccleſiae, Gran</hi> and <hi>Albaregalis,</hi> in the Year 1544; <hi>Temeſwar, Lippa,</hi> and ſome others in the Year 1548: Whereupon <hi>Ferdinand</hi> finding himſelf too weak to deal with that potent warlike Prince, in the Year 1549 offered him 30000 Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats of yearly Tribute for <hi>Tranſylvania:</hi> But this Deſign failing, in the Year 1551, he forced the Queen of <hi>Hungary</hi> to reſign <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> to whom in lieu of it he gave <hi>Caſſovia,</hi> and a Penſion of 100000 Ducats yearly. And in the Year 1552, he made <hi>Stephen Dobus,</hi> who had performed great Services for him againſt the <hi>Turks</hi> this Year in the Defence of <hi>Agria,</hi> Vaivode of <hi>Tranſylvania:</hi> He continued qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly in the Poſſeſſion of it, till the Year 1556; and then another Diſturbance aroſe in this Principality, which is ſhortly hinted at by King <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> in his Letter to the Dyet at <hi>Ratisbonne.</hi> Among other things, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had promiſed, That he would not burthen <hi>Tranſylvania</hi> with any Garriſons of Foreigners; But whether out of Neceſſity, or for fear of the <hi>Turks,</hi> he had kept a ſtrong Guard of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Soldiers there, who had done great Injuries to the Inhabitants; whereupon one <hi>Peter Petrowic,</hi> underhand, dealt with <hi>Solyman</hi> for ſupplies, and began a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt in favour of one <hi>John,</hi> whoſe Family is not known, who then aſpired to this miſerable Principality, and hoped by drawing the <hi>Turks</hi> into <hi>Hungary,</hi> to gain the greateſt part of that Kingdom for himſelf, and had called a Dyet at <hi>Thorda,</hi> in <hi>March,</hi> 1555, which was diſappointed by the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> The <hi>Turks</hi> were not without their Complaints too, for tho' <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had ſent Ambaſſadours to treat a Peace, yet <hi>Solyman</hi> being engaged in a War with the <hi>Perſians,</hi> he was not at leiſure, or perhaps not much inclined to make a Peace with <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> but kept his Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours two Years at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to little or no Purpoſe; and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> being thus held in Suſpenſe, was forced to keep great Garriſons in his Frontier Towns, and among them the <hi>Heyducks</hi> were imployed, who having no Pay, made frequent inroads into the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Quarters towards <hi>Quinque Eccleſiae,</hi> and often ſurprized the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Boats, as they paſſed upon the Rivers; nor was it in <hi>Ferdinand</hi>'s power to reſtrain them, as things then ſtood. Hereupon the <hi>Turks</hi> began a War with the Town of <hi>Kapoſwar,</hi> which was treacherouſly reſigned to them by the Garriſon, and after it <hi>Babotz,</hi> and paſſing on, they attempted <hi>Sigeth,</hi> and came within Cannon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot of it; but <hi>Ladiſlaus Kerezen,</hi> the Governour, gave them ſuch a warm Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the Baſſa's Tent being pierced with a Cannon-ſhot, he was forced to remove farther off, and three hundred of his Men being ſlain in two Sallies, and Winter coming on, he was fain to Withdraw. This paſſed in the Year 1555.</p>

               </note> 
               <hi>Solyman</hi> ſent <hi>Haly</hi> an <hi>Albanian,</hi> whom he had recalled from the Wars of <hi>Perſia,</hi> to be Viſier of <hi>Buda;</hi> but with a Command not to enter that City, till he had taken <hi>Sigeth:</hi> He coming to <hi>Sirmiſh,</hi> ſent a Meſſenger to demand <hi>Sigeth</hi> of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> who replyed, <hi>He had Ambaſſadours at the Port, treating of a Peace; he had done no Injury, and therefore deſired he might receive none, but was reſolved to defend himſelf if he were attacked.</hi> Whereupon the Baſſa comes on, and finds <hi>Mark Horwatch</hi> Governour of the Town, who had ſworn the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, conſiſting of two thouſand Foot, and one hundred and eighty Horſe, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Town to the utmoſt.
<note place="margin">The Situati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Sigeth.</hi>
               </note> It is ſeated in a marſhy Plain, and on the North it has Dikes, which bring the Waters of the River <hi>Alme</hi> into the three Ditches, which ſtrengthen the Town; On the Eaſt it has a ſtrong Caſtle, which had two Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, and the nature of the Site made it impoſſible to make uſe of Mines againſt it; and it was then a very Populous Place. <hi>Haly</hi> came before it the tenth of <hi>June,</hi> and finding nothing but Force could take it, the thirteenth he raiſed a Battery of nine Canon on the South ſide: Whilſt this was battering the Town on that Side, he plaid his Granadoes on all the other, which burnt moſt of the Houſes, and a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51585:3"/>part of the Walls, which were made of Clay and Straw; the twentieth of <hi>June,</hi> the <hi>Turks</hi> took the Counterſcharpe, and the next Night they filled the ſecond Dike with Faggots, and built another Battery on the Weſt Side of the Town, which the Defendants were not able to deſtroy. The next day, a great Breach being made in the ſecond Wall, tho' the Town had burnt ten thouſand Loads of Wood, which had been thrown in to fill the Dike, yet the <hi>Turks,</hi> after four furious Aſſaults, which ſucceeded not, took the Town at the fifth, and the Garriſon retreated into the Caſtle. The <hi>Turks</hi> drew a Trench between the Caſtle and the Town, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure themſelves; but the Townſmen and Soldiers finding themſelves too much pen'd up for want of Room, made ſo furious a Sally upon the <hi>Turks,</hi> that they ſlew eighty of them, and recovered the Town. The next day, which was the twelfth of <hi>July, Haly</hi> renewed the Battery on the Weſt Side, and that Night ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted a third Battery againſt a Tower called <hi>Haney,</hi> and a Gate near it, and drew a Trench round the Town to drain the Dikes, which he endeavoured to fill under the new Battery, and in this Work he ſpent five Days. When by this means he had drained the Dikes, he raiſed a fourth Battery over againſt the Caſtle, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to play it with great Fury againſt the Caſtle, twenty thouſand Carts being imployed, in the mean time, to fill the Dikes, on the Eaſt Side with Wood; but the Defendants fired that too, and under the Cover of the Smoak, made a furious Sally on the <hi>Turks,</hi> who were labouring to put the Fire out, and ſlew ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of them. They made the ſame Attempt of filling up the Dikes, and with the ſame Succeſs, on the Weſt Side, the Wood being burnt, and four hundred <hi>Turks</hi> cut off by a Sally. <hi>Haly</hi> by this time began to find his Hopes of prevailing by Force abated, ſo he fell to fawning and Flattery, and made them very kind and obliging Promiſes, if they would ſurrender; but this was to no purpoſe, ſo he fell to fill the Dikes with Sacks of Earth, and to raiſe Works with Skeps to beat off the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants. The twelfth of <hi>July</hi> he raiſed another Platform againſt the Caſtle, and bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered it with that fury for five Days, that the Town was almoſt reduced to Deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and ſent a Meſſenger to King <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> to beg Relief; but conſidering how long they muſt ſtay for it, they re-aſſumed their wonted Courage, and made a brave Irruption, in which they fired all the Wood that had been thrown into the Dikes. This abated the Fury of <hi>Haly</hi> ſo effectually, that he lay only pelting the Town with his Cannon to the twenty firſt of <hi>July,</hi> and then was glad of an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to draw off to ſuccour <hi>Babots,</hi> which was aſſaulted by one <hi>Nadaſad,</hi>

                  </note> Emperour of the <hi>Romans, Auguſt,</hi> &amp;c. to all and every the Electoral Princes, as well Eccleſiaſtical as Secular, the Prelates, Counts, Barons, Knights, Nobles, Captains, Viſcounts, Governours, Lieutenants, Magiſtrates, Judges, Burgomaſters, Conſuls, Citizens and Commonalties, and all other the Subjects of the ſaid Empire, our Faithful and beloved People, of what State, Dignity or Condition ſoever, We wiſh Friendſhip, Grace, and every Good Thing. We being admoniſhed by many and great Reaſons, and very much burthened with Our great Age, and with continual Annoyance of our Infirmities, which has almoſt overpower'd Our Natural Strength, and rendred Our Body infirm, which makes Us unfit for Buſineſs; and having long ſince determined, That Our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould go to the moſt Serene Prince, <hi>Philip</hi> Our Son, King of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>England:</hi> And having thereupon abandoned Our uſual Palace, We have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved with Our Court hither, in order with the firſt good Wind to embark for <hi>Spain,</hi> all things being now ready for that purpoſe, ſo that Our Voyage can be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by none but God: Wherefore by this Our Abſence, the Government of the Sacred Empire belongs to the moſt Serene and Potent Prince, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of the <hi>Romans, Hungary</hi> and <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and Our deareſt Brother, as being lawfully elected King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the next unconteſtable Succeſſor after Us; the which Government has even already many Years ſince, by our Aſſent, been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by him, in our Name, with great Affection, he having born the Weight of of it (for us) with a true brotherly and kind Solicitude. That therefore the Chriſtian Commonwealth, and eſpecially the Sacred Empire, may ſuſtain no Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage (which God prevent) whilſt We are afar off; and that Our ſaid Brother, the King of the <hi>Romans</hi> may tranſact all Affairs with the greater Authority, We have reſolved and declared, That as King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> he ſhall have Power ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely of himſelf, without Our Concurrence to do, treat, and command all thoſe things, which to him ſhall ſeem neceſſary and convenient, to the Dignity, Profit and Increaſe of the ſacred Empire; in the ſame manner as We could have done the ſame as Emperour of the <hi>Romans.</hi> In truth there is nothing which We deſired ſo much, as to have been preſent in Perſon in your Dyet, before this Our Voyage, which is now aſſembled at <hi>Ratisbonne,</hi> one of our Imperial Cities, and to have brought the Publick Affairs to their deſired End, by your Advice, and then to have committed the Government to Our Brother, the King of the <hi>Romans</hi> in it, in our ſtead, whereby we might have admoniſhed you, to pay him that Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which is due to him. But Our Indiſpoſition of Body, which is known to all, would not ſuffer Us to take ſo long a Journey, and eſpecially by Land. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, We conſider, that the Slipping this favourable Seaſon for Sailing, is a thing of great Conſideration—Wherefore, we being not able perſonally to come to the Dyet, as We deſired and determined to do; nor to bring Our Deſigns to their Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: Yet We were deſirous to make known Our Affection and Devotion to you all by this Edict, and diſcovery of our Mind; and thereby expreſly to command all and every of you, by the tenour of theſe Letters, and by the Imperial Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, under Pain of our greateſt Indignation, That ye, as hath been often ſaid, yield to the ſaid King of the <hi>Romans</hi> Fidelity, Obedience and Reverence, in Our Name, and ſtead in all his Edicts, Commands and Actions, and that ye do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt or diſobey him in any thing, but obſerve him in all things, as You ought to do to us, if we were preſent in the Empire; leſt by doing otherwiſe, or ſuffering your ſelves to be perſuaded to the contrary, you do excite and procure Our great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Indignation.

            <p>The Emperour knew very well,

            <p>In the mean time <hi>John</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Trier,</hi> of the Family of the Counts of <hi>Iſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> died, and <hi>John Laien</hi> ſucceeded him; and <hi>Adolph</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Cologne</hi> was ſucceeded by <hi>Anthony</hi> his Brother.</p>

He arrived ſafely at <hi>Laredo,</hi> a Port in <hi>Biſcaye,</hi> where he was entertained by a great concourſe of the Nobility, and Deputies of the Cities of the Kingdom of <hi>Spain.</hi> So ſoon as ever he ſet his Foot upon the Shoar, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated himſelf upon the Earth, and kiſſing it he ſaid, <hi>Hail my beloved Mother,

After this he ſpent two Days at <hi>Valladolid</hi> with his Grand-ſon <hi>Don Carolo,</hi> inſtructing that unfortunate Prince in the Rules of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Virtue; and doubtleſs it was a noble Lecture which ſo great a Prince, like another Patriarch, made to his ſuppoſed Heir.</p>
            <p>From hence this Glorious Prince retired to a Place he had choſen,
<note place="margin">The deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the Place in which he liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> to ſpend the remainder of his Life, being a Valley in the Borders of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal;</hi> equally Delightful for the Temper of the Air, and the Pleaſant Crown of Hills which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circled it, and ſuppoſed to be the Place where the famous <hi>Sertorius</hi> was baſely murthered. It is well watered with Springs and Rivolets, and rarely Fruitful, and lies about eight <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miles from <hi>Placentia,</hi> a City of the Kingdom of <hi>Leon,</hi> by the Town of <hi>Scaradilla;</hi> this Place he had remarked in Hunting, and had ordered a ſmall Apartment of ſeven Rooms, fourteen Foot ſquare to be built for him; and here he lived with twelve Servants, and one Horſe for his own uſe, having reſerved an hundred thouſand Crowns for his Subſiſtence, which was not over well paid neither, ſpending his Time in the innocent Arts of Grafting, Gardning, and Reconciling the Differences of his Clocks, which yet he could never make to ſtrike together; <hi>and therefore ceaſed to wonder, He had not been able to make Men agree in the Nicities of Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here he firſt heard of the breach of Truce between his Son and the King of <hi>France;</hi> and though he was ſomething concerned at it,

He was born at <hi>Sleidan,</hi> a Town in the Dukedom of <hi>Juliers,</hi> near <hi>Dueren,</hi> and from thence he took his Name; a Perſon, who for his Learning and great Experience in Affairs was much eſteemed by that Age: He had ſpent the greateſt part of his Youth in <hi>France;</hi> and being entertained in the Family of <hi>Bellay,</hi> had both learned and done great things in the Service of Cardinal <hi>John Du Bellay;</hi> but a ſharp Perſecution ariſing in <hi>France</hi> againſt thoſe that were ſuſpected of <hi>Lutheraniſme,</hi> he went and lived at <hi>Strasburg,</hi> and ſerved that Free City, and being by his own Employments much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the Carriage of Affairs, he added to what he had ſeen, what he had learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Men worthy of Credit, and wrote his Book of Commentaries.</p>

That he might have no occaſion to proceed as he intended to do, not only againſt the</hi> Lutherans, <hi>but even againſt them too, as Abettors of them.</hi> But all this Ranting Zeal miſſing its due
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51585:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>Effect he began his Revenges on King <hi>Philip,</hi> the Son of the Emperour, who was the beſt Friend that See had then in Chriſtendom, by denying to admit him to the Kingdom of <hi>Naples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Marc Antony Colonna,</hi> a Favorite of <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> had about this time diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed <hi>Aſcanius</hi> his Father, who was a Subject of the Popes, but had a great Eſtate in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> of all that lay in that Kingdom upon pretence that he was infected with Hereſie, that he favoured the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt againſt the Emperour, and that he lived a diſſolute Life: And the Accuſation had been countenanced and encouraged by King <hi>Philip</hi> to that height, that the Father, as much as in him lay, at his Death diſinherited his Son, giving his Eſtates in the Papacy to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and thoſe in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> to <hi>Victoria</hi> his Daughter, the Wife of <hi>Garzia de Toledo.</hi> This was made the Pretence of the enſuing War between the Pope and the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> into which the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> were drawn too, and all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom almoſt imbroiled again.</p>
            <p>The Pope however, conſidering that he was not able to deal alone with ſo Potent a Prince as King <hi>Philip,</hi> under pretence of ſending Cardinal <hi>Caraffa</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> to congratulate the five Years Truce, imployed his Intereſt with the King of <hi>France,</hi> to perſuade him to break his Faith ſo lately given, and to renew the War with <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip.</hi> The Pope had before, upon ſeveral Pretences, clapt up the leading Cardinals, and great Men of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Faction: And when the King, with all the Reſpect his Zeal for that See could inſpire him with, by his Ambaſſadour, deſired the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of theſe Priſoners, and the Reſtitution of <hi>Marc Antony Colonna</hi> to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Eſtate and Caſtles in the Papacy, the angry Pope Replyed, <hi>That he had Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Right to puniſh his Subjects for their Offences.</hi> And commanded his Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour to write to his Maſter, <hi>not to meddle with what did not belong to him, and that he ſhould permit him as Pope, to exerciſe his Soveraignty freely on his own Subjects.</hi> And accordingly he ſeized all <hi>Colonna</hi>'s Caſtles and Eſtates in the Dominions of the Church, pretending to revenge the Wrongs he had done to <hi>Aſcanius</hi> his innocent Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with the conſent of his Mother, who was alſo ſeverely treated by the Pope; and not contented with all this, he declared the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> forfeited to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe King <hi>Philip</hi> had neglected the Payment of eight thouſand Crowns due as a yearly Tribute for that Kingdom,
<note place="margin">He annexes the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> to the See of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note> and now many Years in Arrear; whereupon his Holineſs publiſhed an Edict, by which he annexed that Kingdom, as forfeited to the See of <hi>Rome;</hi> and began to fortifie <hi>Paliano</hi> a City of <hi>Champagna di Roma,</hi> thirty miles from <hi>Rome</hi> to the Eaſt, and put a thouſand <hi>French</hi> into it for a Garriſon, which the more exaſperated the King of <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke <hi>de Alva,</hi> who was then Vice-roy of <hi>Naples,</hi> did all that was poſſible to mitigate the Pope;
<note place="margin">The Duke <hi>de Alva</hi> begins a a War upon the Papacy.</note> but his Submiſſions and Proteſtations more incenſed him, his Flatterers perſuading him they proceeded more from Fear than a Reverence of the Holy See, which he ſo much pretended. Whereupon the Vice-roy raiſed twelve thouſand Foot and fifteen hundred Horſe, and entring the Popes Territories, he took <hi>Ponte Corvo,</hi> upon the River <hi>Garigliano,</hi> one of the Pope's Towns, in the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>Terra di Lavoro,</hi> without reſiſtance, and after that <hi>Fruſilione,</hi> the Pope's Forces flying out of it in the Night. Hereupon the Pope alſo levied ten thouſand <hi>Italian</hi> Foot and ſeven hundred Horſe, to which he added two thouſand <hi>Gascoigners,</hi> which were old Soldiers, ſent him by the King of <hi>France;</hi> and impriſoned one <hi>Lofredo,</hi> who was ſent by the Duke <hi>de Alva</hi> to perſuade the Pope to a Peace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the War was begun, and ſtaid at <hi>Rome</hi> for the Pope's Anſwer.</p>
            <p>The Duke <hi>de Alva,</hi> hearing this, preſently marched to <hi>Anagni,</hi> another City in the ſame Province,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anagni</hi> taken.</note> which the Pope had made his Magazine; but here meeting ſome Reſiſtance, he ſat down before it, and ſent the Duke of <hi>Toledo</hi> to take <hi>Veruli,</hi> in which he found ſome Difficulty, which he revenged by plundering the Town: Another of his Commanders took <hi>Babuco,</hi> and beat out the Pope's Forces; the other Places made no reſiſtance. In the interim, the Walls of <hi>Anagni</hi> being ruined, the Governour in the night-time blew up the Powder and fled, and left the City to the Mercy of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who plundered it with great Security.</p>
            <p>Whilſt this was doing, <hi>Commilo Orſino</hi> fortified <hi>Rome,</hi> and prepared it for a Siege, by cutting down all the Trees,
<note place="margin">

But when the Noiſe of the taking <hi>Anagni</hi> and the other Towns came to <hi>Rome,</hi> nothing could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51585:5"/>the Citizens, but fearing another Sack like that of <hi>Bourbon</hi> in the year 1527, they would not be quiet till the Pope ſent Embaſſadors to <hi>Alva</hi> to Treat of Peace.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Alva</hi> took <hi>Valle di Montone</hi> without reſiſtance, and finding himſelf deluded with the pretence of a Treaty, he took <hi>Paleſtrina</hi> and <hi>Segni;</hi> after this he marched to <hi>Tivoli,</hi> which ſubmitted without any diſpute to his will, who received the City under his Protection, and would not ſuffer his Soldiers to enter into it. Thoſe of <hi>Vico-Varo,</hi> a ſtrong and populous Town upon the <hi>Teuerone,</hi> promiſed <hi>Orſino</hi> to defend themſelves bravely; but ſeeing their Fields, Gardens, Vineyards and Countrey Houſes go to wrack, they deſired <hi>Orſino</hi> to provide for himſelf, who thereupon ſent to <hi>Alva</hi> for leave to march away with Drums beating and Colours flying, as if no enemy had been near, which the civil good natured enemy granted, and thereupon he entred the Town; and though he promiſed to leave but ſixty <hi>Spaniards</hi> in gariſon, took the liberty afterward to do as he thought fit. This Town by reaſon of its Greatneſs, Strength and Populouſneſs, might have defended it ſelf againſt a greater Army than that of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> if they had had the Courage; and was ſurrendered very opportunely for the <hi>Spaniard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Pope began to want Money, but durſt ask none of the Citizens of <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe they were at great charges to fortifie the City: He ſolicited the <hi>Venetians</hi> alſo, to enter into the War, but they were for a Peace between the Parties; but then there was ſo much Pride on the one ſide, and ſo much Anger on the other, that nothing could be effected. The <hi>French</hi> that were in the City were very troubleſome to the <hi>Romans</hi> for want of their pay, which occaſioned many Thefts and Robberies, and that in the day time. <hi>Alva</hi> having refreſhed his Forces a ſmall time after the taking <hi>Vico-Varo,</hi> drew them into the Field and took <hi>Toſcolano San Marino, Grotta Ferrata</hi> and <hi>Gandolſo,</hi> and from <hi>Grotta Ferrata</hi> marched towards <hi>Oſtia.</hi> The inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Nettuno</hi> ſubmitted to him, and defended his men againſt thoſe of <hi>Velletri,</hi> who aſſaulted them in the Suburbs of <hi>Nettuno.</hi> The Pope ſeeing his weakneſs, ſent again to the <hi>French</hi> King to declare a war againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and at laſt obtained his deſire in that point.</p>
            <p>The Duke <hi>De Alva</hi> coming before <hi>Oſtia</hi> (this City was heretofore a very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable place, but being ruined by Wars and time, and now almoſt deſolate,

The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> was on the way for <hi>Italy</hi> with a great ſupply, and the Pope in the time of the Truce, was very earneſt with the <hi>Venetians</hi> to joyn with him, but to no purpoſe.

            <p>In <hi>France, Henry</hi> the Second having been won by the Arts of Cardinal <hi>Caraffa</hi> to break his Oath, the Admiral <hi>Coligni</hi> the Sixth of <hi>January</hi> attempted to ſurpriſe <hi>Doway,</hi>

In the mean time the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> had paſſed the <hi>Alps,</hi> in the depth of the winter, with an Army of Twelve Thouſand Foot and Five Thouſand and Three Hundred armed Horſe, and Eight Hundred and Eight Light-Horſe, with which Forces he beſieged <hi>Valenza,</hi> a ſtrong Town in the Dutchy of <hi>Milan;</hi> and after he had battered it five daies,

He diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantled the Town, but at the requeſt of the Pope, he preſerved the Caſtle. From thence he paſſed into the Dukedome of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> where he was reſpectively enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the Duke, who had declared for the Pope, but he would not go with him to <hi>Bononia,</hi> fearing his Countries might be invaded by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and their Allies in his abſence; but however the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> went thither with his Forces, where he found an hearty welcome, but no Forces to joyn with him, which much diſpleas'd him.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Pope finding the inconvenience of having <hi>Oſtia</hi> in the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies hands, which deprived <hi>Rome</hi> of the benefit of the Sea,

            <p>In the Spring the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> began the War with the Sack of <hi>Compli,</hi> a ſmall City of <hi>Abruzzo,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The War in <hi>Italy</hi> under the Duke of <hi>Guiſe.</hi>
               </note> which being taken by Scalado was ſeverely treated; the Spoil of this City was eſtimated at two hundred thouſand Crowns, great part of which was found in the Ruines of the City, where it had been hid many Ages, and was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the Inhabitants. The 24 of <hi>April,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> ſat down before <hi>Civitella,</hi> a City of <hi>Abruzzo,</hi> built upon an high Hill, and very ſteep on the North, on the top of which it had a Caſtle, ruined by its own Inhabitants, in the time of <hi>Charles</hi> VIII, for fear it ſhould have been Garriſon'd by the <hi>French.</hi> This City would not yield, and therefore the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> was forced to ſtay before it till the Cannon could be brought from <hi>Ancona</hi> and <hi>Ferrara</hi> to batter it; but when all was done, this ſmall place, by the nature of its ſituation, and the Courage of its Inhabitants, baffled all their Attempts, and forced the <hi>French,</hi> after a long Siege, to retire, and leave it. The Women of this Town contributed very much to the ſaving of it, not only by working at the Breaches, tho' many of them were ſlain by the Enemies Shot, but alſo by taking mens Cloaths, and appearing in Arms among them in the ſight of the Enemy, ſo that the Defendants ſeemed more numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than indeed they were.</p>
            <p>In the mean time,
<note place="margin">The Duke <hi>de Alva</hi> takes the Field.</note> 
               <hi>Alva</hi> having brought an Army of 16000 Foot and 2000 Horſe, conſiſting of <hi>Spaniards, Germans</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> together with a good Train of Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery brought him by Sea, he marched out of <hi>Peſcara, May</hi> 10, and drove the <hi>French</hi> out of <hi>Givlia,</hi> a Sea-port-Town, about ten miles eaſt of <hi>Civitella;</hi> whereupon the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> having loſt above half his Army, left <hi>Civitella,</hi> the 15 of <hi>May,</hi> when they had lain before it twenty two Days.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Florence</hi> took the Opportunity of this diſtracted State of Affairs, and by pretending he was much inclin'd to joyn with the <hi>French</hi> and Pope againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> which would certainly have ruined their Power in <hi>Italy,</hi> forced King <hi>Philip</hi> to give up the City and State of <hi>Siena</hi> to him, who accordingly took Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it <hi>July</hi> 19. This whole intreague is deſcribed at length by <hi>Thuanus,</hi> but I am forced to be very ſhort, the nature of this Supplement not admitting ſuch long Digreſſions.</p>
            <p>Towards the latter end of the Summer,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Segni</hi> taken by the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Segni,</hi> a ſtrong City of <hi>Compagnia di Roma,</hi> having made the beſt Defence it could, fell at laſt into the Hands of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who plundred and burnt it, and ſlew the greateſt part of the Inhabitants. When the Pope heard the deplorable News of the Sack of <hi>Segni,</hi> he fell into a fit of Melancholy, and ſaid, <hi>He deſired to be with Chriſt, and would with great Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Satisfaction, expect the Crown of Martyrdom,;</hi> As if (ſays <hi>Thuanus</hi>) this had been the Cauſe of God: And that he had not been brought into this great Danger and Trouble, by a War which his Relations had involv'd him in, with great Raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Ambition.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that were about him could not forbear Smiling; and knowing very well, That as the Pope had begun this War without Cauſe or Provocation, ſo he might end it when he pleaſed upon Juſt and Honourable Terms, King <hi>Philip,</hi> and his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, the Duke <hi>de Alva,</hi> being both extremely addicted to the See of <hi>Rome:</hi> And therefore taking this Opportunity, they perſuaded the Pope to ſend <hi>Alexander Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidi,</hi> a Knight of great eſteem, to the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> to treat about a Peace, by whom alſo the Cardinal of <hi>Sanfloriano</hi> ſent a private Account of the beating the <hi>French</hi> at S. <hi>Quintin,</hi> which as it ſunk the Pope's Intereſt, ſo it raiſed the <hi>Spaniſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this the Duke <hi>de Alva</hi> took up a Reſolution to ſurprize the City of <hi>Rome</hi> by Night, and treat with the Pope within the very Walls of <hi>Rome;</hi> and he came very early in the Morning under the Walls of <hi>Rome,</hi> and found the City in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Quiet, and altogether unprovided, ſo that in all probability he might have ſurprized it without the leaſt Reſiſtance; but as he took an Oath of the Captains, That they ſhould not ſuffer their Soldiers to plunder or ſack the City, ſo it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily thought, upon great Reaſons, That his Fear the <hi>Switz</hi> and <hi>Germans</hi> would have done this whatever he or his Officers could have done or ſaid to prevent it, made him ſtop, and by his Preſence try if he could affright the Old Pope into a Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. However, <hi>Thuanus</hi> is of Opinion, he truly deſigned to ſurprize the City, but that his Heart failed him, when it came to the Point of Execution.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time there came Letters from the King of <hi>France,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> recall'd.</note> to recal the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> where his Preſence was abſolutely needful, and the Pope had his Hoſtages returned, and was left at Liberty to take the beſt care, he could of his own Affairs: Yet when the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> came to ask the Pope's leave to return, upon the account of the great Neceſſity of his Maſter's Affairs,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51585:6"/>there was a ſharp conteſt between the Duke and the Pope, inſomuch that his Holineſs told the Duke, <hi>He had done very little towards the advancing his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters Intereſt, or the Good of the Church in this Voyage, and much leſs for the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of his own Honour and Reputation.</hi> In the mean time the Duke <hi>de Alva</hi> withdrew his Army to the Town of <hi>Colonna.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Florence</hi> had now obtained what he deſired,
<note place="margin">A Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween King <hi>Philip</hi> and the Pope.</note> by gaining the State of <hi>Sienna,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> was gone for <hi>France,</hi> the Pope's Forces were ſufficiently baffled, and his Towns lay at the Mercy of the Enemy, his Treaſures were ſpent, and the <hi>Venetians</hi> had abſolutely refuſed to aſſiſt him; So that the Pope was now forced to come to a Treaty of Peace, in good earneſt, and it was well he had the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and the Duke <hi>de Alva</hi> to treat with, conſidering in what State his Affairs were.</p>
            <p>The Peace was however agreed at laſt, upon theſe Terms. I. That the Duke <hi>de Alva,</hi> in the Name of his Maſter, ſhould beg the Pope's Pardon, and it ſhould be granted. II. That the Pope ſhould renounce the Amity with <hi>France.</hi> III. That the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould reſtore to the Pope one hundred Towns and Caſtles he had taken in this War, the ſame being diſmantled firſt; and that they ſhould reſtore thoſe Eſtates they had ſeized, to the proper owners. IV. That both Parties ſhould remit all Wrongs, Injuries and Loſſes Suſtained during the War, and Pardon all that had taken Arms on either Side: And that <hi>Paliano</hi> ſhould be put into the Hands of <hi>Bernardo Carbone,</hi> a Kinſman of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raffa</hi>'s, to be kept by him for both Parties, with a Garriſon of eight hundred Men, till they ſhould otherwiſe diſpoſe of it by mutual Conſent.

The Place meant was <hi>Roſſano,</hi> a Populous and Rich City in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> which was to be granted to him by the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> with the Title of a Principality, which he might transfer to whom he pleaſed, if not an Enemy of the King of <hi>Spain's.</hi> That upon the delivery of this Grant and Place, <hi>Paliano</hi> ſhould be diſmantled, and <hi>Caraffa</hi> ſhould yield up all his Right in it to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> which he alſo might aſſign to whom he pleaſed, if he were not Excommunicated, or the Pope's ſworn Enemy; which was added to exclude <hi>Mark Anthony Colonna,</hi> and was eaſily granted by the Duke <hi>de Alva,</hi> in complyance with the Moroſe and Inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orable Humour (they are <hi>Thuanus</hi>'s Words) of the Old Gentleman, who would ſoon die, and then the King might diſpoſe of <hi>Paliano</hi> as he thought fit.</p>
            <p>The Duke <hi>de Alva,</hi> in a ſhort time after went to <hi>Rome,</hi> and on his Knees begged the Pope's Pardon, with as much Humility as could have been wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And the Pope abſolved him and his Maſter with as much Haughtineſs as ever need to have been uſed.</p>

            <p>The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> ſhipped his Men at <hi>Civita Vechia</hi> for <hi>France,</hi> and himſelf took Poſt-Horſes, and went by Land.

            <p>Our Author <hi>John Sleidan</hi> has only given us the Letter or Speech which began the Dyet at <hi>Ratiſbonne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Dyet of <hi>Ratisbonne.</hi>
               </note> but dyed before he could give us any account of the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions there: After they had conſulted of thoſe things which related to the State, and the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> War, there aroſe ſome debate concerning the compoſing the Differences of Religion. And here it was firſt agreed, That all that had been done in the Treaty of <hi>Paſſaw,</hi> and the Dyet of <hi>Ausburg,</hi> concerning the Peace of Religion, ſhould remain firm and immoveable. But then thoſe of the <hi>Auguſtane</hi> Confeſſion, preſented to King <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> by their Deputies, a Proteſtation, in Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <q>That King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had performed a moſt uſeful Office,
<note place="margin">A Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance of the Proteſtant Princes.</note> for the good of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom, by ſetling a Peace, in the Matters of Religion, between the Princes and the States of <hi>Germany:</hi> But then he had annexed a Limitation, which was very Grievous, That no Archbiſhop, Biſhop, Abbat, or other Eccleſiaſtical Perſon, ſhould receive the <hi>Auguſtane</hi> Confeſſion, but that he ſhould reſign his Office, and be deprived of the Revenues thereunto belonging. That thoſe of the <hi>Auguſtane</hi> Confeſſion did not conſent to this Limitation, nor can they now conſent to it; becauſe this was a denying them the Benefit of imbracing the Sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and True Doctrin of the Goſpel, by which not only the Biſhops but their Subjects too, were driven out of the Kingdom of God, which was not fit to be done. Beſides, it was a Reproach to their Religion, to ſuffer thoſe who ſhould imbrace the <hi>Auguſtane</hi> Confeſſion, to be judged unworthy of the Sacred Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery: And therefore they could not approve this Reſtriction in the Dyet of <hi>Ausburg,</hi> without doing Injury to the Glory of God and their own Conſciences; neither can they now conſent to it. That this Limitation was an Hindrance to the ſo much deſired Union of Religion, ſeeing thereby the Biſhops were deprived of the Liberty of ſpeaking their Minds freely in Matters of Religion, becauſe they ſhould thereby forfeit their Office and Revenues, if they approved of the True Religion. That on the contrary, the Peace would be much ſtronger be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Princes and States of the Empire, if Religion were perfectly Free. That therefore the Electors, Princes and States, who had imbraced the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtane</hi> Confeſſion, deſired now (as they had alſo formerly done in the Dyet of <hi>Ausburg</hi>) That this grievous Limitation and Reſtriction might be aboliſhed; and that it might be free for all Eccleſiaſtical Perſons to imbrace the <hi>Auguſtane</hi> Confeſſion, and ſuffer their Subjects to imbrace it. That they of the <hi>Auguſtane</hi> Confeſſion did not by this, deſire that the Revenues of the Church ſhould be diſſipated, or turned to Profane Uſes, or annexed to certain Families; but they would take great Care to prevent theſe Inconveniences, and do their utmoſt in it. And that by this means the true Intention of the Founders ſhould be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, tho' the Profeſſion of the True Religion ſhould be permitted, for it was, without doubt, their Deſign, to have the Pious and Sincere Service and Worſhip of God Promoted and Setled, tho' they err'd in their Choice. That the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, Princes and States, aforeſaid, would ſuffer the Publick and Civil Buſineſs of the Empire to be diſpatched in this Dyet at <hi>Ratisbonne;</hi> but then they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them, their Deputies, not to give any conſent to any thing, till the ſaid Limitation were taken away: But then, if it was once Aboliſhed and Repealed, they were ready and willing to aſſiſt and promote the Publick Affairs in this Dyet, to the utmoſt of their Abilities.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Proteſtation or Remonſtrance was very often renewed afterwards in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of their Dyets; but being always oppoſed by the Princes of the oppoſite Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and by the Emperours, it could never be obtained; becauſe they ever thought, That the granting this Liberty, would end in the Rnine of the Roman Catholick Religion. On the other ſide, thoſe of that Religion wrote ſharply
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51585:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>againſt the Peace of Religion, as it was then eſtabliſhed by the Treaty of <hi>Paſſaw,</hi> and the Dyet of <hi>Auſburg,</hi> calling it a <hi>Lawleſs Confuſion;</hi> and in private, ſaying, <hi>That as it was obtained by a War, ſo it must by a War be revoked.</hi>

            <p>In the Year 1556, the Thirty firſt of <hi>July, Ignatius Loyola,</hi> the Founder of the Order of Jeſuites, died, in the Sixty fifth year of his Age. He was born in <hi>Spain,</hi> and at firſt ſerved as a Soldier; which Employment he deſerted in the Year 1521, upon a Wound received at <hi>Pampelune.</hi> In the Year 1528 he began to gather Companions. In the Year 1534 or 35 this Order was firſt framed by him; and in the Year 1609 he was Canonized by Pope <hi>Paul</hi> IV. And (as <hi>Petavius</hi> ſaith) it was confirm'd by <hi>Paul</hi> III, in 1540, the Twenty ſeventh of <hi>September. James Lainez,</hi> a Spaniard, was this Year his Succeſſor, and the ſecond General of that Order; which had then ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd One hundred Colleges in ſeveral Parts of Chriſtendom, as one of that Society aſſures us.</p>

            <p>In <hi>April</hi> died <hi>John</hi> Count Palatin of <hi>Simeren,</hi> Preſident of the ſaid Imperial Chamber, and the Father of <hi>Frederick,</hi> who about two years after ſucceeded <hi>Otho Henry</hi> in the Palatinate of the <hi>Rhine.</hi> He was a Prince of great Learning, and managed this Truſt with the higheſt Commendations both for his Prudence and Juſtice.</p>

               <note place="margin">The County of <hi>Catzenello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bogen</hi> ſetled by Agreement.</note> which had been depending Fifty Years, and is often mention'd by <hi>Sleidan</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the County of <hi>Catzenellobogen</hi> was friendly ended at <hi>Frankfort</hi> upon the Main, by the Interpoſition and Mediation of <hi>Otho Henry</hi> and <hi>Auguſtus</hi> Electors, <hi>William</hi> Duke of <hi>Cleves,</hi> and others, who were made Judges in this Affair for both Parties, the Landgrave of <hi>Heſſe</hi> by their award retaining that County, upon paying to <hi>William</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> 1600 Crowns, and reſigning up to him the Earldom of <hi>Diez</hi> for 1050 Crowns.</p>
            <p>When the time of the Conference appointed by the Dyet drew near, the Divines who were of the <hi>Aguſtane</hi> Confeſſion, had a Meeting at <hi>Frankford</hi> on the Main, the Firſt of <hi>August,</hi> to adjuſt their own private Differences before they entred into a Conference with the <hi>Roman Catholicks;</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence at <hi>Wormes.</hi>
               </note> ſo that this latter was not begun till the beginning of <hi>September.</hi> At the opening of it, <hi>Julius Pflug,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Naumburg,</hi> who was Preſident in this Conference, deſired thoſe of the <hi>Auguſtane</hi> Confeſſion, that they would in the firſt place ſhew openly their Diſagreement with, and Deteſtation of the <hi>Zuinglians, Oſiandrians, Synergiſts,</hi> and <hi>Adiaphoriſts:</hi> Becauſe the Peace of Religion was only granted to thoſe of the <hi>Auguſtane</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion by the Dyet, and this Conference was appointed with none but them, and the Emperor beſides knew that moſt of them had Orders to do this: That therefore ſome benefit at leaſt might reſult from this Conference, they would once for all, by a common conſent, condemn theſe Errors, and there would be much leſs danger and difficulty in the reſt. The younger Miniſters and Deputies of <hi>Saxony</hi> eaſily aſſented, and producing their Inſtructions, were very forward to ſeparate the <hi>Auguſtane</hi> Confeſſion from theſe Errors. But <hi>Philip Melancthon</hi> (an old wiſe Man, who ſaw the drift of this cunning Gameſter) ſaid the Examination and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51585:8"/>Explication of their ſeveral Doctrins ought to go before the Determination and Condemnation of them; and that till this was done, they ought not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. The <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> who were weary of the Conference, thereupon would go no further in it, till they had given an Account of this to the Emperor. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> commanded them to go on, and ſaid it was enough if in the Progreſs of the Conference, when they had explained the ſeveral Articles, they did at laſt remark what was diſallowed, by the common conſent, in each of them. But the Biſhop of <hi>Naumburg</hi> refuſing to go on, except he were firſt certain of the Faith of thoſe he was to diſpute with, the Conference broke up without effect, when there had only been ſome Papers exchanged between them concerning the Rule of Judging Controverſies and Original Sin. And all the blame was by the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> thrown upon the Diviſions which were among them. Thus far <hi>Thuanus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the deſign of this Condemnation was a Diviſion of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Intereſt; that whereas they were too many for the <hi>Romau Catholicks</hi> while they were united, they might h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ave the Conſent of thoſe of the <hi>Auguſtane</hi> Confeſſion to ruin the <hi>Zuinglians,</hi> and then they ſhould, with the leſs difficulty, extirpate by the Sword the <hi>Lutherans</hi> too; and in the mean time they knew very well they were never able to convince them by a Diſputation, when it was utterly impoſſible they ſhould ever agree about the Rule that was to end theſe Differences; the Roman Catholicks <hi>Aſſigning the perpetual Conſent of the Church:</hi> And the Lutherans, <hi>the Old and New Teſtaments, and the Ancient Creeds; and allowing no other Writings but as far as they agreed with theſe, ſome Ages being purer than others.</hi> Certainly no wiſe Man of either Side ever did think that any of theſe Conferences could put an end to theſe Controverſies; though they have made uſe of them to promote by Ends. And that Side that was uppermoſt, hath ever yet reaped the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; and ſo it will be, till God himſelf put an End to this Controverſie.</p>
            <p>But to return now to the War between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </note> The Truce being broken by the Attempt upon <hi>Doway,</hi> which I have mention'd already; the War went heavily on, becauſe the Flower of the Nobility and Gentry were gone with the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> which had much diſpirited and weakned <hi>France.</hi> And the Duke <hi>de Montmorancy,</hi> who from the beginning had a great Averſion for this War, which he foreſaw would end in the Ruin of <hi>France,</hi> was more intent in levying Soldiers to defend the Borders of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> than in proſecuting the War againſt King <hi>Philip,</hi> and Invading his Dominions. In the mean time, Queen <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>England,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Queen <hi>Mary</hi> joyns with <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </note> being over-perſuaded by King <hi>Philip</hi> her Husband, and diſpoſed to it by the Arts of Dr. <hi>Wotton,</hi> who was then her Embaſſadour in <hi>France,</hi> and by his Nephew, who found the <hi>French</hi> were well diſpoſed to a Rupture with <hi>England,</hi> if <hi>Calice</hi> might be the Prince of it, ſhe I ſay entred into the War too, and ſent an Herald to the French Court with a Declaration to that purpoſe, who deliver'd it the Seventh of <hi>June.</hi> The French King took no leſs care to raiſe a War between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> by way of Diverſion, <hi>Mary</hi> the Queen of <hi>Scotland</hi> being before this ſent into <hi>France</hi> to be married to the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> his Eldeſt Son. So that he thought he had now a Right to Command that Nation to eſpouſe his Quarrel; but the Scotch Nobility thought otherwiſe, and would not Engage in a War againſt <hi>England,</hi> when they had no intereſt of their own to do it.</p>
            <p>The Spaniards were all this while intent in providing Men and Arms, and the Twenty fifth of <hi>July</hi> attack'd the Fort of <hi>Rocroy,</hi> in the Borders of <hi>Champagne</hi> and <hi>Hainalt,</hi> four Leagues from <hi>Maribourg</hi> to the South; but finding there a greater Reſiſtance than they expected, they marched away towards <hi>Picardy</hi> with an Army of Thirty five thouſand Foot, and Twelve thouſand Horſe. The Body of the French Army being but Eighteen thouſand Foot, and Five thouſand Horſe, and for the moſt part, both Sides Germans; ſo that the French thought it their Intereſt to coaſt along by the Enemy, and defend their Borders, and cover their Towns, which was all they could ſafely do in this inequality of Forces. There was then a very ſmall Garriſon in St. <hi>Quintin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Siege of St. <hi>Quintin.</hi>
               </note> under the Command of <hi>Charles de Teligny,</hi> Captain of the Troop of Guards belonging to the <hi>Dauphin;</hi> but the Army coming ſuddenly before it, the <hi>Sieur de Coligny</hi> the Preſident of <hi>Picardy,</hi> put himſelf into the place with ſome few Forces, and ſent to <hi>Montmorancy</hi> to come up and ſuccour him. This was diſapproved by thoſe about him as Dangerous, and if things ſucceeded not, Diſhonourable. In the beginning of the Siege, <hi>Teligny</hi> was ſlain in a Sally, by Engaging imprudently beyond his Orders, who
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51585:8"/>was a Perſon of great Courage and Strength, Induſtry and Fidelity, and an Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienc'd Commander. And <hi>Andelot,</hi>

               </note> who was ſent by <hi>Coligny</hi> to bring Two thouſand Foot into the Town, was, by a miſtake of his Guides, miſled, and falling into the Trenches of the Beſiegers, he was ſlain, and moſt of his Men cut off; and <hi>Montmorancy,</hi> attempting to relieve the ſame place, was beaten alſo, and loſt Two thouſand five hundren Men, and himſelf was taken Priſoner. This Battel had a fatal effect upon <hi>France;</hi> for it made the Life of <hi>Henry</hi> II ever after Unfortunate, and reducing <hi>France</hi> to the neceſſity of a diſhonourable Peace, it became the occaſion of the Civil Wars which followed, to the great hazard of the Ruin of that Potent Kingdom, and may ſerve as an Example to Princes, not to violate their Faith, whoever diſpenſe with it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Montmorancy</hi> was from the beginning averſe to this War,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Montmorancy</hi> ruin'd by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner.</note> and foretold the ill Conſequences of it; as he was an old, experienc'd, wiſe Commander, and a great Lover of his Country, ſo till then he had lived in great Power, and enjoyed the Favour of his Prince; but now when his good Fortune left him, he loſt the good Eſteem and Regards of all Men; which from thence forward were conferred upon the Duke of <hi>Guize,</hi> who employ'd them to the damage of <hi>France,</hi> The News of this Victory fill'd <hi>France</hi> with Terror and Sorrow, and the <hi>Netherlands</hi> with Joy and Courage. The Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi> and ſome others of the principal French Commanders however eſcaped.</p>
            <p>If the Victorious Army had forthwith marched to <hi>Paris,</hi> they might have taken it; but King <hi>Philip</hi> was reſolved to hazard nothing, but commanded his Army to go on with the Siege of St. <hi>Quintin;</hi> and the King of <hi>France</hi> leaving <hi>Compeigne,</hi> where he then was, and going to <hi>Paris,</hi> ſo quieted the Minds of the People by his Preſence and good Words, that things began to ſettle, and the fear in a ſhort time to abate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Coligny</hi> kept the Townſmen of St. <hi>Quintin</hi> two days in Ignorance of this Loſs, and when they came to hear of it, though he ſaw the Town would at laſt be taken, yet he perſuaded them to hold it out to the laſt, that ſo the King might have time to recollect his Forces, and be in a condition to oppoſe the Victorious Enemy. Another of the <hi>Andelot's</hi> got into the Town, with about Five hundred Choſen Men, and ſome few Volunteers of the Nobility; but when all was done, King <hi>Philip</hi> coming in Perſon into the Camp, and the Siege being carried on with great dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, the Town was taken by Storm the 27th of <hi>August,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Day of the Battel.</note> and <hi>Coligny</hi> and <hi>Andelot</hi> became Priſoners too, and the latter was wounded. At this Siege there was Eight thouſand Engliſh employed, who did great Service; but finding themſelves ill uſed after the Town was taken, they returned to <hi>Calis.</hi>
               <note place="margin">St. <hi>Quintin</hi> taken by Storm.</note> There were above Four hundred French Soldiers ſlain in this Town, and Three hundred taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners; and more had periſhed, if King <hi>Philip,</hi> who was preſent, had not entred the City, and by Proclamation reſtrain'd the fury of his own Soldiers, to whom he granted the Plunder of the Town, which was great, and took particular care that thoſe who had not been concern'd in the danger of the Storming the Town, might have no ſhare in the Plunder of it.</p>
            <p>Soon after this Victory, King <hi>Philip</hi> ſent an Expreſs to the late Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> his Father, who was then in his private Retirement in <hi>Spain,</hi> deſiring him to ſend his Advice how to proceed; the wiſe and good Prince return'd him an Anſwer to this purpoſe, as the Great <hi>Thuanus</hi> relates it.
<note place="margin">A Letter of <hi>Charles</hi> V, to his Son <hi>Philip.</hi>
               </note> 
               <q>Though this Retreat gives me the utmoſt ſecurity, yet I received the Account of your Victory with a joyful and a pleaſed Mind; and I congratulate the happy and fortunate Beginnings of my beloved Sons Reign; and I render to God Almighty my humbleſt and devouteſt Thanks and Praiſes, who hath not ſuffer'd the Perſidy of his Enemies to go long unpuniſhed, but has thus ſuddenly chaſtiſed the Truce-breakers both in <hi>Italy,</hi> and on the Borders of the <hi>Netherlands.</hi> For though my mind foretold me it would come ſo to paſs, and I comforted my ſelf with that hope, yet I was vex'd that juſt at that time, when I had reſtored Chriſtendom to her Peace, and was going to compoſe my Soul in Peace, all things ſhould of a ſudden be fill'd with an unexpected War and Tumult. But then as to the Advice my Son deſires from me, he is not to expect it either now or hereafter. He has with him many grave and wiſe Men of an approved Fidelity, and bred up to Buſineſs during my Reign, whoſe Counſel I would take if I were now at the Helm. Let him conſult with theſe Men, and well conſidering the weight of their Reaſons, after he has firſt implored the Divine Aſſiſtance and Grace, let him determine what is beſt to be done.</q> 
               <hi>This Wiſe Prince would neither put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51585:9"/>to the Trouble of conſidering what was beſt to be done, nor his Son to that of approving what perhaps he would not have liked, or of rejecting the Counſels of a Father, which would have been diſhonourable to both. He had been ſo long a Sovereign, that he knew the Thoughts and Tenderneſs of a Princes Heart, and could diſtinguiſh between Civility nnd reality. And which was moſt of all, he was really, and not pretendedly Dead to the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Germans</hi> tumultuouſly demanded their Pay, after the Victory; the <hi>Engliſh</hi> alſo deſired leave to return, pretending they had been ill uſed, and the King was forced to grant their Requeſt, to prevent worſe Conſequences; So that in a ſhort time this victorious Army moulder'd to nothing, tho' his Captains did what they could to perſuade him to keep his Army up. And, which was yet worſe, many of the <hi>Germans</hi> paſſed over to the <hi>French,</hi> and helped to fill up their Numbers; ſo that King Philip took only <hi>Caſtelet, Han, Chaulnes</hi> and <hi>Noyon,</hi> all ſmall Places, and this laſt by Surprize too. And then, in the latter end of <hi>October,</hi> was forced to withdraw his Army into the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> having in the mean time fortified S. <hi>Quintin, Han</hi> and <hi>Chaulnes</hi> to preſerve them.</p>
            <p>Whilſt the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army was thus mouldering away and diſperſing, the <hi>French</hi> King was every Day increaſing his.

            <p>The Diſorder of the War diverted Men from the Thoughts of Perſecuting the Proteſtants in <hi>France,</hi> ſo that now they grew and multiplied very much, even in <hi>Paris.</hi> The fifth of <hi>November,</hi> in the Evening, there was a great number of theſe met in a Place called <hi>Bertomier,</hi> in S. <hi>James-ſtreet,</hi> to perform the Offices of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and to receive the Lord's Supper after their way. This being diſcovered by ſome, that lived near that place, they provided good quantities of Stones, in the neighbouring houſes, and their Arms ready in the Street; and when in the dead of the Night the Meeting broke up, they that firſt went out had Stones thrown at them; and a Tumult thereupon ariſing, a vaſt number of the Rabble at that Signal, came running together, and attempted to break into the Houſe; they that were yet in the Houſe, adviſed by their Danger, drew their Swords, and iſſued out, and all of them, except one (who was ſlain in the Crowd) made their eſcape tho' ſome were wounded. The Women, and others, who were leſs able to ſhift, to the number of one hundred and twenty, rendred themſelves to <hi>Jean Martignon,</hi> the then <hi>Sheriff,</hi> who, when it was now Day, carried them to Priſon, the People being hardly kept from pulling them in Pieces, by the Conſtables and their Guards.

<note place="margin">The miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations of the Roman Catholicks againſt the Proteſtants.</note> 
               <hi>That this Rabble met in a Chamber in the Night, to Eat and play the Whore, and that after the Supper was over, they committed promiſcuous Villanies, the Mother lying with the Son, the Father with his Daughter, and the Siſter with her Brother; That the Tables and Proviſions were found, and that the Carpets and Tapeſteries had ſtill upon them the Marks of theſe Villanies: And becauſe this was not enough, they added, to enrage the Multitude yet more againſt them; that they had Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated in the Blood of a Child.</hi> This Account was given to the King, but without any Author to juſtifie it; but then no Man daring neither to contradict it, for fear of being taken for an Heretick; thoſe that were of the Religion, wrote a ſmall Piece, which they called an Apology, in which they ſhew, That the Crimes thus laid to their Charge were meer Slanders, and they cited Paſſages out of the Fathers of the Church, to ſhew that the ſame Forgeries had been made uſe of by the Pagans againſt the Primitive Chriſtians; and that they might be ſure it might come to the King's Hands, they got it conveyed into his Bed-chamber; which Book was afterwards anſwered by <hi>Anthony de Mouchy,</hi> a Divine, and the chief of the <hi>Inquiſitors,</hi> and by <hi>Robert Cenali,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Auranches.</hi>

There had been a Law publiſhed to the ſame purpoſe by <hi>Lewis</hi> XI, the thirteenth of <hi>January</hi> 1476, which was now revived, Men judging that Preaching was a likelier way to fix Men in their Religion than Fire and Faggot.

Its Form is Square, and at three of its Corners, it has Royal Baſtions, and the fourth, which is towards the South, has an Ancient but ſtrong Caſtle for its Defence; beſides, it has a ſtrong Bulwork of Earth, which is very high and thick, but is of ſo ſandy a nature (as the <hi>French</hi> found after this, to their Damage) that the force of a Cannon ſcattered it like duſt. The Rivers and Marſhes encompaſſing the Town on all Sides, there was no Paſſage to it but by a Cauſey from the Fort of <hi>Newnham,</hi> nor was it poſſible for any Ship to enter the Town, but what paſſed under the Fort of <hi>Risbank,</hi> ſo that theſe two Forts were the great Securities of the Town, which were both now in the Hands of the <hi>French;</hi> after which they lodged on the Cauſey and Banks twenty Foot Companies, and one <hi>German</hi> Regiment, and one thouſand one hundred Horſe: The Marſhal <hi>de Termes</hi> ſecured the Way leading to <hi>Guines,</hi> with the reſt of the Horſe and the <hi>Switz.</hi> The fifth of <hi>January</hi> they began to batter the River-gate with four whole Cannon; and three hundred Culverins were imployed againſt the other parts of the Walls and Bulworks, but their main Battery was againſt the River-gate, whilſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> drew almoſt all their Forces on this Side; the Gate and ſome of the next Towers being much battered, the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> ordered fifteen Cannon ſuddenly to be planted againſt the Caſtle, the Walls of which were not faced with Earth within; this Battery was plaid with that Fury, that the Noiſe of the Cannon was heard as far as <hi>Antwerp,</hi> which is thirty three <hi>German</hi> Miles to the North: A great Breach being made there, <hi>Andelot</hi> was commanded to paſs the River, and lodge himſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the other Side with one thouſand two hundred Muſqueteers; after this they drew the Water out of the Town-Dike, which was thought by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> the greateſt defence they had, and by pitched Hurdles they laid a Paſſage over the muddy Dikes and marſhy Grounds for the Soldiers, and ſecured the Foot from the Annoyance of the Small-ſhot by other Hurdles about half a foot thick, which had Stakes fenced with Iron to ſtrike into the Ground, and Loop-holes to ſhoot through. The Night after (the Walls being now battered down) the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Grammont,</hi> with three hundred Small-ſhot, to play all Night into the Breach, to hinder the <hi>Engliſh</hi> from making any Works within the Caſtle, for their Defence. <hi>Strozzi</hi> was ordered at the ſame time to lodge himſelf with the ſame number of Foot and one hundred Pioneers, on the other Side, near the Gate, but was beaten off by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Small-ſhot, and forced to return to the Duke of <hi>Guiſe.</hi> The next Morning, the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> having ordered the Breach at the Caſtle to be carefully viewed, <hi>Grammont</hi> was ordered with three hundred Muskets, to enter the place, who was to be ſeconded by <hi>Strozzi,</hi> with the ſame number; theſe paſſed the Dike in Water up to the Navel, and notwithſtanding any reſiſtance the <hi>Engliſh</hi> could make, lodged themſelves in the Caſtle, driving thoſe of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> that had not been ſlain, into the Town. The Caſtle being thus gained, the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> put a ſtrong Garriſon into it. The <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſo ſoon as the Tide re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned again (which filled the Dikes) ſtormed the Caſtle, in hopes to regain that important Poſt, and being beaten off, they planted four Cannon againſt the Bridge, and forced open the Caſtle-gate, and then ſtormed it the ſecond time, but having loſt two hundred of their beſt Men to no good purpoſe, they then began to treat of a Surrender; which at laſt was agreed; The Governour and fifty others being to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Priſoners of War; The Soldiery and Townſmen to be at liberty, to paſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Flanders,</hi> without any Injury, as to their Lives or Liberties: And all the Ammunition, Cannon, Houſholdſtuff, Gold, Silver, Merchandiſe and Horſe, was to be left to the diſpoſal of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe.</hi> On theſe Conditions was <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lais</hi> delivered up to the <hi>French,</hi> the fourteenth of <hi>January</hi> 1557, 58, when it had been two hundred and ten Years in the hands of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> The Place was no ſooner yielded up but great numbers of Ships came over, who underſtanding what had paſſed, returned back. King <hi>Philip</hi> had ſmelt the Deſign of the <hi>French</hi> upon this Place, and had wrote to Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> that he would put Succours into the Town; but this was ſuſpected, by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as a Deſign to get <hi>Calais</hi> into his own Hands, and ſo his Prediction came to paſs.</p>
            <p>After <hi>Calais</hi> was taken they fell to conſider,

But they reſolved to attempt <hi>Guines,</hi> which was nearer, and more neceſſary for the ſecuring the Poſſeſſion of <hi>Calais,</hi> the Lord <hi>Gray</hi> was Governour of it, who had a good Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, and had received ſome Succours from King <hi>Philip;</hi> yet at the firſt Attack he left the Town, and fled into the Caſtle; but whilſt the <hi>French</hi> were plundering
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51585:10"/>the Town, returned again, and drove them out, and firing the Town returned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Caſtle again, which in a ſhort time after he ſurrendred, when he had eight hundred <hi>Engliſh, Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>Flemmings</hi> to have continued the Defence of it; but the Hearts of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were down, for <hi>Gray</hi> was reputed a good Soldier.</p>
            <p>There was now nothing left to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> but a ſmall Place call'd the <hi>Comte de Oye,</hi> which had a Caſtle not ſtrong, but almoſt unacceſſible, as being ſurrounded with unpaſſable Marſhes, and which had no Paſſage but over a Timber-Bridge: This Place lies almoſt two Leagues from <hi>Calais</hi> towards <hi>Graveling,</hi> the Garriſon of which never ſtaid for a Summons, but hearing of the loſs of <hi>Guines</hi> fled, and left the Place open and unguarded, and <hi>Sipetra</hi> took poſſeſſion of it, without any further trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for the <hi>French. Burnet</hi> calls this Caſtle <hi>Hammes,</hi> and <hi>Thuanus Oye;</hi> but the Caſtles of <hi>Hammes</hi> lay directly between <hi>Guines</hi> and <hi>Calais.</hi> One Sir <hi>Edward Grim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone</hi> was then Comptroler of <hi>Calais</hi> and a Privy Counſellor, and he had often given Advertiſement of the ill condition of the Garriſon; but the Treaſury was low, the People diſcontented, and the Thoughts of the Queen and her Council more ſet upon extirpating Hereſie (as they called it) than upon preſerving this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Poſt, ſo it was loſt, and the Grief and Diſhonour of this Misfortune ſat ſo heavy upon the Spirits of the Queen, that ſhe never joyed after.</p>
            <p>The next thing the <hi>French</hi> undertook was the taking of the Caſtle of <hi>Herbemont,</hi> in the Foreſt of <hi>Ardenne,</hi> belonging to the Count of <hi>Beiliſteine,</hi> which was very troubleſome to the Inhabitants of <hi>Ivoy;</hi> this enterprize ſucceeded well too, and they took the Caſtle the ſixteenth of <hi>February,</hi> and after it ſeveral other ſmall Places on the Frontiers, were deſerted by their Garriſons.</p>

            <p>The <hi>French</hi> by this time had got together a very great Army, which the King ſaw drawn up near <hi>Pierre-pont;</hi> and King <hi>Philip</hi>'s was not leſs, but then neither of theſe Princes were diſpoſed to try the Hazards of the War any further; and <hi>Montmoren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> having agreed for his Ranſome, at the rate of one hundred and ſixty five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Crowns, and being now grown old, and averſe from the Thoughts of War, he and <hi>Chriſtierna,</hi> the Mother of the Duke of <hi>Loraine,</hi> went to and for between the two Princes, to promote a Treaty of Peace.</p>

               <hi>Vendoſme Vidame of Chartres,</hi> who was made Governour of <hi>Calais,</hi> after <hi>Thermes</hi> was taken Priſoner,
<note place="margin">The Treaty of <hi>Cambray</hi> began.</note> had a Deſign upon S. <hi>Omers,</hi> but it was diſcovered and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented. In the middle of <hi>September,</hi> Ambaſſadours from <hi>England, France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> met at <hi>Cambray,</hi> to treat of a Peace in good earneſt, and the firſt thing they agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon, was the withdrawing of the two Armies, becauſe they ſeemed very diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant from the End of that Meeting. The greateſt Difficulty they met with was about <hi>Calais,</hi> which the <hi>French</hi> were reſolved to keep, pretending it was an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Piece of their Dominions, tho'lately recovered: And the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> on the other ſide, would never conſent to the Treaty, if it were not reſtored: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Conteſt could be brought to a concluſion, <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>England</hi> dyed, which ended the Controverſie for the preſent, and thereupon this Congreſs was diſſolved, and another Meeting appointed in the ſame Place in <hi>January</hi> following.</p>
            <p>The fifth of <hi>November</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament met,
<note place="margin">The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> meet, and Queen <hi>Mary</hi> dies.</note> but in a very ill Temper. On the ſeventeenth day of that Month, the Queen dyed, in the forty third Year of her Age, when ſhe had reigned five Years four Months and eleven Days. Her Death was for ſome Hours concealed, and then it was communicated to the Houſe of Lords by the Lord Chancellour, who ſent for the Houſe of Commons, and the Lord Chancellour ſignified to them alſo the Queen's Death; and both Houſes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently agreed to proclaim <hi>Elizabeth</hi> her Siſter Queen, <hi>wiſhing her a long and a happy reign.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The great <hi>Thuanus,</hi> contrary to his Cuſtom, paſſeth over Queen <hi>Mary</hi> without any Character; he could ſay little that was good of her, and would ſay nothing that was ill. Thoſe of her own Religion are now ſo ſenſible of the Errors of her Government, that they are more put to it for Apologies than Panigyricks on her Memory.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Germany</hi> a Dyet was appointed to meet at <hi>Frankford</hi> the twenty fourth of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>German</hi> Affairs.</note> to which the Ambaſſadours named by <hi>Charles</hi> V, before his Voyage into <hi>Spain,</hi> came and delivered his Reſignation of the Empire, by which he had transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Authority to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> his Brother, then King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> to the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, who after a ſhort deliberation accepted the ſame, and in a ſolemn manner elected and admitted <hi>Ferdinand</hi> to the Empire, and afterwards crowned him. After his return to <hi>Vienna,</hi> he ſent <hi>Martin Guſman,</hi> his Lord High Chamberlain, to <hi>Rome</hi> to acquaint the Pope with the Reſignation of <hi>Charles</hi> V, and his Advancement to the Empire, and to aſſure his Holineſs of his good Affections to that See. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe Old Gentleman would not admit the Ambaſſadour, but left the buſineſs to be diſcuſſed by the Cardinals, who were appointed for that purpoſe; who muſt needs make a great buſineſs of it, and reſolved, <hi>That what had been done at</hi> Frankford <hi>was of no Validity, becauſe the Holy See had not conſented to it, and Chriſt's Vicar, who was entruſted with the Keys of the
<note n="*" place="margin">That is the Eccleſiaſticai and Civil Government.</note> Celeſtial and Terreſtial Government, without whoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, neither</hi> Charles <hi>could be diſcharged from the Empire, nor</hi> Ferdinand <hi>be admitted. That no Reſignation or Deprivation could be made to or by any other than the Pope. Beſides what was done at</hi> Frankford, <hi>had been tranſacted by Men infected with Hereſie, who had loſt all that Grace and Power, which belonged to them, whilſt they were Members of the Church of</hi> Rome: <hi>That therefore</hi> Ferdinand <hi>was to appear within three Months before the Pope's Tribunal, to anſwer for his Miſdemeanours, and to ſhew his Repentance; and then without doubt he would obtain Pardon from this meek Father:</hi> With much more to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ferdinand</hi> was of another Temper, and ordered his Ambaſſadour to return, if he were not admitted within three Days, leaving a Proteſtation behind him. This a little quelled the Pope, who admitted him to a Private Audience the thirteenth of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51585:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>July,</hi> when the Pope <hi>excuſed himſelf for not having granted his Requeſt ſooner, for want of Leiſure and Time to examine all the Difficulties which were propoſed in this Affair by the Cardinals; and ſeeing his Lordſhip could ſtay no longer at</hi> Rome, <hi>he might return when he pleaſed, and he would ſend an Ambaſſadour to the Emperour</hi> (ſo he called <hi>Charles</hi> V, notwithſtanding his Reſignation) <hi>as ſoon as was poſſible.</hi> And thus this thing ſtood till the Death of Pope <hi>Paul</hi> III.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charles</hi> V, late Emperour of <hi>Germany,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Death and Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth;</note> being at laſt overpowered by the many Diſeaſes which oppreſſed him, died the twenty firſt of <hi>September. In this Prince</hi> (ſaith <hi>Thuanus</hi>) <hi>Fortune and Virtue ſtrove to Crown his Deſerts with the utmoſt degree of Temporal Felicity. And for my part, I take him for the beſt Pattern which can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be given of a virtuous Prince, in this or any former Age.</hi> His laſt Words were theſe, <hi>Continue in me my dear Saviour, that I may continue in thee.</hi> He lived fifty eight Years, ſix Months and twenty five Days, and was Emperour of <hi>Germany</hi> thirty ſix Years.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thuanus</hi> ſaith of him, That no part of his Life was deſtitute of ſome commendable Action, yet he ſhew'd the greatneſs of his Soul moſt viſibly in the cloſe of it: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was wont to conquer others, in this he overcame himſelf, and reflecting on a better Life, renounced this preſent, which was lyable to ſo many Chances, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he dyed; and having ſo many Years lived to the good of others, began now to live only to God and himſelf. In all that two Years which went next before his Diſſolution, he lived in the Society of ſome Monks of the Order of S. <hi>Jerome;</hi> and by the Advice of one <hi>Conſtantin,</hi> his Confeſſor, applied himſelf chiefly to the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> and fixing his Soul only on God, thus he argued:
<note place="margin">His Opinion concerning Juſtification.</note> That he was unworthy, by his own Merits, to obtain the Kingdom of Heaven; but his Lord God, who had a double Right to it, that of Inheritance from his Father, and that of the Merits of his Paſſion, was content with the firſt as to himſelf, and has left the ſecond to me, by whoſe Gift I may juſtly claim it, and truſting to this Faith, I ſhall not be aſhamed: For neither can the Oyl of Mercy be put in any other Veſſel than that of Faith: That this is the only Confidence of that Man who forſakes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and relies upon his Lord: That to truſt any otherwiſe to ones own Merits was not of Faith but Perfidy: That Sins were forgiven by the Mercy of God, and therefore we ought to believe that none but God can blot them out, againſt whom only we have ſinned, in whom is no ſin, and by whom alone our ſins are forgiven, us. Theſe Doctrins were afterwards thought in <hi>Spain</hi> to approach ſo near thoſe of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> that his Confeſſor was burnt for an Heretick after he was dead; and ſome others that were about him had hard meaſure, after his Death, on that account, and <hi>Lucas Oſiander</hi> affirms, in expreſs Terms, That <hi>Charles</hi> V, dyed a <hi>Lutheran</hi> in the Point of Juſtification.</p>
            <p>Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> preſently after her ſettlement,
<note place="margin">Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> ſucceeds.</note> diſpatched Meſſengers to all the Princes of Chriſtendom, giving notice of her Siſter's Death, and her Succeſſion, and among them, to the Pope alſo, by Sir <hi>Edward Karn,</hi> then Reſident at <hi>Rome.</hi> His Holineſs, in his uſual Stile replyed; <hi>That</hi> England <hi>was held in Fee of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick See, That ſhe could not ſucceed, being illegitimate, nor could he contradict the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations made in that matter by his Predeceſſors</hi> Clement <hi>VII, and</hi> Paul <hi>III: He ſaid it was a great boldneſs in her to aſſume the Crown without his Conſent; for which, in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſhe deſerved no Favour at his Hands: Yet if ſhe would renounce her Pretentions, and refer herſelf wholly to him, he would ſhew a Fatherly Affection to her, and do every thing for her that could conſiſt with the Dignity of the Apoſtolick See.</hi> It was great pity this generous Pope ſhould fall into ſuch Heretical Times; his great Soul would certainly have wrought Wonders berfore the Days of <hi>Luther;</hi> but now alaſs! all this Papal Meekneſs ſerved only to render that ſinking Ship more deſpicable and hated; for Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> when ſhe heard of it, was nothing concerned at it, but immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſhe recalled <hi>Karn</hi>'s Powers, and commanded him to come home: And Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from hence forward fared very will in <hi>England;</hi> but then our Affairs have been ſo exactly deſcribed by others, and are ſo well known to Engliſh Men, That I ſhall here diſmiſs them, and apply my ſelf wholly to the Foreign Affairs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thuanus</hi> obſerves,
<note place="margin">The <hi>Scotch</hi> Affairs.</note> That this Year there was rather no War than a Peace in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> for that the whole Kingdom was imbroiled with Rapines and the burning of Towns, two of the principal Nobility of <hi>Scotland</hi> being carried away captive by the <hi>Engliſh, William Keth</hi> Son of the Earl Marſhal, and <hi>Patrick Gray:</hi> An <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet alſo, under the Command of Sir <hi>John Clare,</hi> infeſted the <hi>Scotch</hi> Shoars, and burnt a Place, by my Author called <hi>Cracoviaca, Kirk-wall, Main-Land,</hi> the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal of the Iſles of <hi>Orkney,</hi> which he ſaith was the Seat of the Biſhop, and the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51585:13"/>principal, or rather only Town in thoſe Iſlands, which he ſuppofeth was ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chaſtized by Heaven, by a Tempeſt, which ſoon after diſperſed the Fleet, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a part of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> on the Iſland, who were all ſlain by the Iſlanders and Natives.</p>
            <p>This Year alſo the Reformation of Religion was much agitated, tho not effected in <hi>Scotland;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Scotland</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</note> Alexander Somervill</hi> Archbiſhop of S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> with the aſſiſtance of the reſt of the Churchmen, condemned one <hi>Walter Mills,</hi> an old Prieſt, to be burnt for Hereſie, and baniſhed one <hi>Paul Mefan,</hi> hoping thereby to reſtore their loſt Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and curb the People; but it had a quite contrary effect, the patient and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Martyrdom of <hi>Mills</hi> incenſing the People to that height, that they ſpoke very freely, or as my Author has it, Licentiouſly and Seditiouſly of the Church-men, and a Solemn Proceſſion being made on the firſt day of <hi>September,</hi> in memory of S. <hi>Eugenius,</hi> or S. <hi>Gile</hi>'s at <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> of which he was Patron, whoſe Image was then carried about with great Pomp, the People tore it out of the Hands of thoſe that bore it, and threw it into the common Drought, having firſt broke off the Head, Hands and Feet of this Wooden Saint, the Monks and the reſt of his Friends fleeing, and leaving him to ſhift for himſelf. The Clergy ſeeing their Authority thus ſinking, aſſembled in a Synod, the ninth of <hi>November,</hi> to try if the ſeting a good Face, and pretending great Conſidence would retrieve their ſinking Cauſe: But they of the Reformed Party, on the contrary, of all Degrees exhorted one another to perſevere in the Truth, <hi>and not to ſuffer themſelves to be oppreſſed by a ſmall and weak number of Men: For if</hi> (ſay they) <hi>theſe Men proceed by Legal Courſes, we ſhall be too hard for them, if they make uſe of Force, we are a Match for them.</hi> They drew up an Addreſs alſo to the Queen Regent, which they ſent unto her by one <hi>James Sandelands,</hi> an Honourable Baron, and of great account, in it deſiring, That the Publick Prayers and Adminiſtration of the Sacraments might be in the Vulgar Tongue, and that the Miniſters might be elected by the People. The Regent, tho' a zealous Catholick, yet fearing a Tumult, commanded the Prieſts to ſay the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the <hi>Scotch</hi> Language. The ſame Demands were made by the Nobility of the Synod, then aſſembled at <hi>Edinburgh:</hi> Who replyed, That they muſt abide by the Orders of the Canon-Law, and the Decrees of the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> The No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility perceiving them thus averſe to a Reformation, ſent one <hi>John Aresken</hi> of <hi>Dundee</hi> a learned Man to appeaſe them; who with great reſpect beſought them, At leaſt to grant the People the uſe of the publick Prayers in their Mother Tongue. The Clergy would nevertheleſs abate nothing of their former Severity; and the Queen regent, by their Perſuaſion ſoon recalled what had been extorted from her. But the Death of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and the Succeſſion of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> which happened this Month, ſoon turned the Scales, and gave her Cauſe to repent her too great obſtinacy.</p>
            <p>The Learned <hi>Spotiſwood</hi> obſerves, That this <hi>Mills</hi> was the laſt Martyr that dyed in <hi>Scotland</hi> for Religion; That <hi>Patrick Lermoth</hi> Bailiff of the Regality, abſolutely refuſed to paſs Sentence of Death, as a Judge upon him, after the Biſhop had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered him up to the Secular Power; that in the whole City of S. <hi>Andrews</hi> a Cord was not to be had for Money, ſo that they were forced to take one of the Cords of the Archbiſhop's Pavilion, to tie him to the Stake. It had been good Prudence to have deſiſted, when they ſaw the whole Body of the People thus bent againſt them, but they were hurried on to their Ruine, by a blind Rage.</p>
            <p>The People of <hi>Scotland</hi> were no leſs incenſed on the other Side, and reſolved openly to profeſs the Reformed Religion, binding themſelves by Promiſe and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription to an Oath, That <hi>if any ſhould be called in queſtion for matters of Religion, at any time hereafter, they would take Arms, and joyn in defence of their Religion and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, againſt the Tyranny and Perſecution of the Biſhops.</hi> The principal Men, who joyned in this Bond were <hi>Archibald</hi> Earl of <hi>Argile, Alexander</hi> Earl of <hi>Glencarne, James</hi> Earl of <hi>Morton, Archibald</hi> Lord of <hi>Lorne,</hi> Sir <hi>James Sandelands</hi> of <hi>Calder, John Erskin</hi> of <hi>Dun,</hi> and <hi>William Maitland</hi> of <hi>Lethington.</hi> To this Bond vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers throughout the Kingdom ſubſcribed, ſo that they found their numbers were at leaſt equal to thoſe that oppoſed them.</p>

               </note> Three Months and Twenty Days, and reigned Thirty four Years. He was a Prince of great Moderation and Juſtice; he overthrew the united Army of <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> Duke of <hi>Oldenburg,</hi> and of the City of <hi>Lubeck,</hi> who had invaded his Inheritance, near <hi>Alſens,</hi>

            <p>In the beginning of this Year was a great change of Affairs at <hi>Rome.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Affairs of <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </note> The Kindred of the Pope had already made themſelves hated by all Chriſtendom, and now the Pope himſelf too fell out with them. they had engaged the Pope in the War with <hi>Spain,</hi> which had brought ſo much Loſs and Shame upon that See, and its Dominions. In the time of thoſe Confuſions they had acted many things with great Rapacity, Intemperance and Inſolence without the Pope's knowledge, who finding his Treaſure exhauſted, had by their Advice raiſed great and extraordinary Taxes upon his People; and beſides all this, had ſold the Places of the Criminal and Civil Judges, ſuppreſſed the monthly Payments of his Officers, and ſeized many of the Lands belonging to the Religious Orders, and had levied two Tenths upon all the Benefices. The War with King <hi>Philip</hi> being ended, and the Pope having with a calm and diſpaſſionate mind heard the Complaints made againſt his Relations by one <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> a Fryer of the <hi>Theatin</hi> Order, and eſpecially againſt the Cardinal of <hi>Caraffa,</hi> began more nearly to inſpect his own Affairs, and the Lives of his Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. About the ſame time, <hi>Coſmus</hi> Duke of <hi>Florenee</hi> made great Complaint alſo of the <hi>Caraffa</hi>'s, becauſe not content with the extorting what they pleas'd from the Hoſpitals, Monaſteries and Clergy within the Pope's Dominions (which they lookt upon as their own) they had alſo by their private Authority done the ſame Wrongs in the Dukedom of <hi>Florence,</hi> and indeed all over <hi>Italy.</hi> He thereupon order'd <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gianni Gianfigliacci,</hi> his Reſident at <hi>Rome,</hi> to complain of this to the Pope; but then the <hi>Caraffa</hi>'s had prevented him from having any Audience; whereupon <hi>Coſmus</hi> wrote a Letter to the Pope, which was by the means of Cardinal <hi>Vitelli,</hi> an Hater of their Inſolence, deliver'd to the Pope. He having read it, ſent preſently for his old Monitor <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and by him ordered <hi>Vitelli</hi> to give him a more exact account of their Miſdemeanors. There was nothing more incenſed the Pope againſt them (who was Imperious and Jealous of his Papal Power to the utmoſt degree) than that the Cardinal had agreed, without his knowledge or conſent, with the Duke <hi>de Alva;</hi> that his Brother ſhould accept of a Compenſation from King <hi>Philip</hi> inſtead of <hi>Paliani,</hi> which Place the Pope had deſigned to unite to his See. Whereupon he preſently commanded the Cardinal to leave the <hi>Vatican,</hi> and not to come any more into his Preſence. The Twenty ſeventh of <hi>January</hi> the Pope ſummon'd a great Conſiſtory, and in it diſcharged him of the Prime Miniſtry of Affairs, and of the Government of <hi>Bononia.</hi> He took alſo from the Duke of <hi>Paliani,</hi> his Brother, the Command of the Forces of the Eccleſiaſtick State, and of the Gallies, and deprived the Marqueſs <hi>di Monte Belli</hi> of the Cuſtody of the Vatican Palace, declaring againſt them with that fury, that ſome of the Cardinals attempted to appeaſe him, and among them <hi>Ranutio</hi> Cardinal of <hi>Farneſs:</hi> To whom he replied, <hi>That your Grandfather had done much better, if like me he had ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed his private Affections to his Paſtoral Office, and having ſeverely chaſtiſed your Father's
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51585:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>abominable Luſts and Villanies, had thereby prevented the ſcandal the Impunity of them hath given to the whole World.</hi> So that nothing that could be ſaid or done, could reduce the old Man from his Reſolves againſt them, but tended rather to the encreaſing of his Fury. And hereupon he forthwith aboliſh'd ſome Impoſts, pretending they were exacted without his knowledge: By all which he hoped to obtain the repute of a Juſt and Upright Prince, and to caſt the Odium of the ill things which had been done in his Popedom, upon his Relations. After this, he betook himſelf wholly to the promoting the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> which he call'd the moſt <hi>Holy Tribunal,</hi> and here he ſhewed a very great ſeverity, bringing not only Men ſuſpected of Hereſie, but of ſome other Crimes within their Juriſdiction. Then commanding all Monks and Nuns to their ſeveral Houſes, he Impriſon'd ſome, and ſent others to the Gallies, for not preſently obeying him. His Rigour was ſo great in this laſt, that many left his State, and went and ſetled in the State of <hi>Venice.</hi> He ſpent Fifty thouſand Crowns in Corn, to relieve the Poor in a time of Scarcity, and ſetled Biſhops at <hi>Malacha</hi> and <hi>Cochin,</hi> two Cities belonging to the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> in the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> and made the Biſhop of <hi>Goa</hi> an Archbiſhop, exempting him from the Juriſdiction of the Biſhoprick of <hi>Liſbon.</hi> He alſo erected many new Sees in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> at the requeſt of <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> to the Diminution of the Juriſdiction and Dioceſſes of many <hi>French</hi> and <hi>German</hi> Biſhops. Theſe Sees were ſetled at <hi>Mechlen, Antwerp, Harlem, Daventrie, Leewarden, Groningen, Midleburg, Boſleduc,
<note place="margin">New Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks erected in the <hi>Low-Countries.</hi>
                  </note> Namur,</hi> St. <hi>Omers, Ipreſs, Gant</hi> and <hi>Bruges,</hi> and were put under the Archbiſhops of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray, Mechlin</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht.</hi> This change gave great offence to the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> who eſteem'd itrather an Inſlaving than an Honouring of their Country, to have ſo many New Sees ſetled among them; and the more, becauſe among other Reaſons aſſigned by the Pope, one was, That theſe Countries were on all ſides encompaſs'd with Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which had caſt off the See of <hi>Rome;</hi> ſo that the Salvation of the Souls of this People was much endanger'd by Schiſm, which rendred this Settlement hateful to all thoſe who favour'd the Reformation; ſo that this was one of the principal Cauſes of the War which followed, which in the end proved fatal to many of theſe New Biſhopricks.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>interim,</hi> this Conſideration had that effect upon the Spirit of King <hi>Philip,</hi>
               <note place="margin">King <hi>Philip</hi> deſirous of a Peace with <hi>France,</hi> that he might be at leiſure to extirpate He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie.</note> that it greatly diſpoſed him above all others to enter into a Treaty of Peace with <hi>France.</hi> He ſaw that not only the Licence which attended a War, but the vaſt number of <hi>Germans</hi> which he was forced to employ, by their converſing with his Subjects in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> begat in them a good Opinion of <hi>Luther</hi> and the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. <hi>Henry</hi> II of <hi>France</hi> imprudently communicated to <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Naſſaw,</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> when he was Embaſſador for <hi>Philip</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> when they were one day Hunting together,

               <hi>That King</hi> Philip <hi>and he had agreed first to extirpate all the Sects which were then riſing in the</hi> Netherlands, <hi>and after that they would joyn their Arms, and do the like in all other places;</hi> which being diſcovered by that Prince to the <hi>Netherlanders,</hi> they entred into Conſultation for the preſerving themſelves from the Pride of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Government, and made thoſe inſolent Demands of King <hi>Philp,</hi> when he was going into <hi>Spain.</hi> This Counſel was then generally attributed to the Cardinal of <hi>Lorain,</hi> and <hi>Perrenot</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Arras,</hi> and all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, That under the pretence of ſuppreſſing Hereſie, King <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>France</hi> had laid a Deſign of Ruining the Civil Liberties of <hi>France</hi> and the <hi>Netherlands.</hi> When the Commiſſioners met, for the concluding the Treaty of Peace between theſe Princes, they found themſelves delivered from one difficulty, the Reſtitution of <hi>Calais,</hi> by the Death of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> but then <hi>Thionville, Verdun</hi> and <hi>Toul,</hi> three Imperial Cities, had been taken in this War by the <hi>French,</hi> and King <hi>Philip</hi> thought he was bound in Honour, and by his Intereſt too, to ſee them reſtored to the Empire, and yet he ſaw the <hi>French</hi> were as well reſolved to keep them. Nor was indeed his Intereſt in the Reſtitution ſo great as that of the <hi>French</hi> was to keep them, he having very effectually provided for his own Security and Benefit, by the gaining other Places.</p>
            <p>Hereupon theſe Princes, by mutual conſent,
<note place="margin">The Dyet of <hi>Germany.</hi>
               </note> ſent Embaſſadors to the Dyet of <hi>Germany,</hi> began this Year the Twenty fifth of <hi>February,</hi> at <hi>Auſburg.</hi> The firſt thing that was done in them, was the celebrating the Funeral of <hi>Charles</hi> V, with great Solemnity. His Encomium was pronounced by <hi>Lewis Madruſe,</hi> then Biſhop of <hi>Trent,</hi> and afterwards a Cardinal. After this Ceremony, an Account was given of the Conference at <hi>Wormes,</hi> for the Reconciling the Differences of Religion; and there appearing no hope of an Accommdation, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Emperor promiſed he would take care to have the General Council renewed, and that all ſhould obey its
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51585:15"/>Decrees and Determinations. But the Deputies of the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and of ſeveral other Princes of the Empire oppoſed this, affirming that there being no hopes of reſtoring the Peace of the Church by a Popiſh Council,
<note place="margin">Conditions propoſed by the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> for a Council.</note> the Edicts of <hi>Paſſaw</hi> and <hi>Anſburg</hi> were religiouſly to be obſerved: But the Emperor perſiſting in his former Opinion, they ſaid they were not againſt a Free and General Council in <hi>Germany,</hi> ſo be it were legally aſſembled by the Emperor, and not by the Pope, and in which the Pope ſhould appear as a Party ſubject to the Council, and not as Preſident and Judge of all others; and provided the Biſhops and Clergy might be freed from the Oath they had taken to the Pope, that they might freely ſpeak their Thoughts: That the ſacred Scriptures might be the only Rule by which they ſhould judge and determin theſe Controverſies, rejecting all humane Traditions and Cuſtoms that were contrary to the Word of God: If the Divines who had embraced the <hi>Auguſtane</hi> Confeſſion, might not only be heard, but admitted to give their Votes in the Deciſion of theſe Controverſies, and have good Security given them for their going thither; and that they ſhould enjoy the Liberty granted them by the Decree of <hi>Auſburg,</hi> without any fraud or violence: That the Points in Diſpute ſhould not be determin'd, as is uſual in Civil Affairs, by the Plurality of Votes, but by the Rule and Preſcription of the Word of God: That in the firſt place, the Decrees of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> already made, ſhould be cancell'd as vitious, and not legally aſſembled; and that theſe things ſhould be debated anew.

            <p>The Twenty eighth of <hi>March,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>French</hi> Embaſſadors come to the Dyet.</note> the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſadors were introduced into the Dyet, and after they had in an Elegant Speech declared the great Affections their Maſter had for the Emperor and the States of <hi>Germany;</hi> they deſired the ancient League might be renewed between the Empire and that Kingdom; and that for the future there might be a firmer and cloſer Union and Friendſhip. Upon this the Emperor returned Thanks to the Embaſſadors, ſaying, That the King might be aſſured of the Friendſhip of the Empire, the Princes and States, and of his too, if his Actions did agree with his Words, and thoſe Cities which had lately been taken from the Empire, were reſtored to it: That this being done, he did not ſee what could hinder their entring into a ſincere Friendſhip. At this the Embaſſadors replied, That they had no Inſtruction concerning what he had propoſed about the Cities, but they would given an Account of it to the King their Maſter, and in the mean time they deſired the States would meet the King's Propoſals of Friendſhip with equal Candour. Upon this the Aſſembly broke up, and the Embaſſadors were re-conducted back with great Civility and Reſpect; to whom it was hinted, that the Emperor could not but mention the Reſtitution of the Cities, but then that neither he, the Princes, nor the States would break with the King of <hi>France,</hi> though thoſe Cities were not reſtored. They decreed alſo a Noble Embaſſy to the King of <hi>France,</hi> in which the Cardinal of <hi>Auſburg</hi> and <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> Duke of <hi>Wirtemburg</hi> were employed.</p>
            <p>One <hi>David George,</hi> a Native of <hi>Delft</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> born of mean Parents, his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being a Fencer, and his Mother a mean Woman, and himſelf unacquainted with
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51585:15"/>any other than his Mother-Tongue; was a Perſon of great ſeeming Moderation, ſo that all took him for a very Honeſt and well-meaning Man, tho' he was of a ſtubborn and incorrigable diſpoſition.
<note place="margin">The Life and Death of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid George,</hi> a famous Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor.</note> He was a Perſon of a comely Countenance-and good meine, and all the Motions of his Body were Grave and becoming, ſo that he ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed made up of Honeſty. This Man ſpread amongſt his Country-men the Peſtilent Sect of Anabaptiſts, to which they were very much diſpoſed, and this being done to his great advantage (for he had got a good Eſtate by it) and fearing he might not be ſafe, if he continued any longer in his Native Country, where he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the Head of that Sect, he went with ſome of his Followers to <hi>Baſil,</hi> in the Year 1544, under the Name of <hi>John Bruck,</hi> and the firſt of <hi>April</hi> made a Speech in the Senate of that City; deſiring, He might be protected by them, as one forced to flee for his Religion; and that they would receive his Wife, Children, Family and Fortunes, as in a ſafe Harbour. The Cauſe, the Perſon, and the Speech, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo exactly, and his Temper was ſo wholely unknown to them, as well as his former Life, and his Country being very remote, what he ſaid appeared ſo like Truth, and had happened to ſo many others, That <hi>Auguſt</hi> 25, having given the uſual Oath, he was taken into the Protection of that City; where he lived with the Reſpect to the Magiſtrate, that Humanity towards the Citizens, and that Civility towards all, obſerving carefully their Religious Rites, and in all things behaved himſelf ſo well, that he gave not the leaſt occaſion to any to ſuſpect him of any erroneous Doctrin, and he was as well thought of by the moſt, as he Deſired to be, or was eſteemed by his own Party. Thus he lived very quietly in his Family, obſerving very ſtrictly three things: 1. Concealing the Name of <hi>David George,</hi> by which he was well known in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Frieſland.</hi> 2. Of what State and Condition he was at Home; ſo that ſome took him for a Perſon of good Birth, others for a Nobleman or Rich Merchant. 3. Laſtly, he took Care not to admit any into his Sect of the City of <hi>Baſil,</hi> or of the neighbouring Country: But, in the mean time, he took care by Letters, Books and Meſſengers, to enlarge his Sect in <hi>Holland,</hi> and in other ſuch diſtant Places: But as to <hi>Switzerland</hi> he medled not, for fear he might be diſcovered. Having thus ſpent ſix Years, with great Pleaſure, there happened a thing which gave him ſome Diſturbance, one of his Followers falling off, upon better Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and appearing with great Zeal againſt the Doctrins of his <hi>quondam</hi> Maſter: His Houſe being alſo burnt with Lightning, was a ſad Preſage, That his good Fortune and his Life were near their End. But that which moſt afflicted him, was, That an able Perſon was come from <hi>Holland,</hi> who had given an exact account of him and his Family, to the Citizens of <hi>Baſil;</hi> this brought a great Deſpondence of Mind upon him, and that a Sickneſs, which ſeized his Wife alſo, who dyed firſt, and <hi>David George</hi> followed her himſelf <hi>Auguſt</hi> 25, 1556; and he was buried with great Pomp, in the Church of S. <hi>Leonard.</hi> Thus died that famous Impoſtor and Deceiver, who had pretended, That he was greater, and more Divine than Chriſt, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal; that the Doctrin of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, Chriſt and the Apoſtles, was imperfect, and did not lead to a true and perfect Felicity; but his was ſuch as would certainly make him, who rightly underſtood it, happy: That he was the true <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> the moſt beloved Son of the Father, who was begotten not of Fleſh but by the Holy Ghoſt, and the Spirit of Chriſt; which having reduced his Fleſh to nothing, and kept it in a certain place, unknown to the Saints, had at laſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered it to <hi>David George;</hi> with much more ſuch Blaſphemous Nonſenſe. After his Death, the Frand broke out, and this Year <hi>March</hi> 12, his Sons, and all that belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, to the number of eleven, were brought before the Senate, and examined concerning his Name, Country and Doctrin: And they anſwering as he had taught, were committed to different Priſons, and all his Papers and Writings were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the Divines. <hi>April</hi> 26, the Divines and Univerſity having conſidered them, condemn'd his Doctrin as falſe, contrary to the ſacred Scriptures, pernicious and injurious to Jeſus Chriſt, and to be exterminated out of the Chriſtian World. After this, his Sons were diſmiſs'd out of Priſon, upon condition they ſhould buy no Lands without the Walls of the City, without the Permiſſion of the Senate: That they ſhould entertain no Travellers, though of their near Relations, but ſhould ſend them to the publick Inns: That they ſhould deliver in all the Books written or printed by <hi>David George,</hi> and not keep any by them in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Tongue; and that they ſhould ſend their Children to the School of <hi>Baſil</hi> to be inſtructed: That they ſhould pay a Pecuniary Mulct, if required; and that they, their Wives and Children ſhould appear in the Church, and make Profeſſion of the True Faith, and Renounce that of <hi>David George.</hi> Two days after, his Body was ſentenc'd to be
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51585:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>taken up and burnt, together with his Books and Effigies, by the Hands of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Hang-man, in the place where they uſally executed Malefactors; and all his Goods they ſeiz'd to the Publick Treaſure; adding, That if any Perſon preſum'd to blame this their Decree, he ſhould be liable to the ſame Puniſhment. His Body was found very perfect, ſo that it might be known by his yellow Beard from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man's, though he had been buried two Years and ſix Months, and was accordingly burnt in a vaſt concourſe of Men.</p>

This laſt Clauſe, by the perverſe Counſels of theſe Princes, in a ſhort time raiſed a War in the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> which was more laſting and more fatal than any former Wars. This Treaty was ſigned at <hi>Cambray, April</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>Theſe two Kings having thus regained their Peace,

               </note> and disburthened themſelves of the Cares which the War brought upon them, they betook themſelves ſolely to the Care of Religion, which in <hi>France</hi> had been under conſideration the two forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Years, and was then omitted on account of the War and Treaty, but was now reaſſumed in the heat of a Marriage-Feaſt. There was one <hi>Diana</hi> Dutcheſs of <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinois,</hi> a Court-Lady, and one of the King's Miſtreſſes, who uſed to beg the Eſtates of all ſuch as ſuffered for any Crime; And the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> who were the Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this Perſecution, the latter aiming at nothing but Popular Applauſe: Theſe two inſinuated this Belief into the King; That <hi>the Venome of Hereſie was much ſpread in</hi> France, <hi>and that in truth he was not King of thoſe Provinces in which that prevailed: That the Impudence of thoſe who imbraced it, was ſo great, that they did not whiſper it, as heretofore, in the Ear, but preached it openly and boldly throughout the Kingdom, by which the name of God was blaſphemed, and his Majeſties Royal Authority was endangered; for when the Law of God was once confounded, who can Queſtion,</hi> (ſay they) <hi>but that all Human Laws will ſoon be ſubverted?</hi> And that they might the more eaſily prevail, they employed <hi>Giles Maiſtre,</hi> preſident of the Parliament, <hi>Jean de S. Andre, Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Minart,</hi> and <hi>Giles Bourdin</hi> the King's Attorney, and principally the firſt of theſe, who was a Man of a fierce Diſpoſition and Temper, to incenſe the King's Mind againſt the Sectaries, he being no way inclined to ſuch Severities. To this end they tell him, <hi>That there would little be gained by the Peace, if a more cruel War was fomented and carried on at Home: For that the Diſeaſe had already got ſuch Strength, that if his Majeſty diſſembled a little longer, the Sword of the Magiſtrate and the Laws of the Land would not be able to ſuppreſs it, but he muſt levy Armies, and himſelf take the Field againſt them, as had been done in the caſe of the</hi> Albingenſes. <hi>That what had hitherto been done, had not had its deſired effect, becauſe all the ſeverity had been ſpent upon the populace and the mean people, the hatred and deteſtation of which had affected all Men, but very few had taken example by it. That now it was fit to begin with the Judges, many of which had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced their Doctrin ſecretly, or favoured them on other accounts, and by their connivance nouriſhed the Diſtemper, ſuffering this Offence either to go unpuniſhed, or very lightly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected. This, they ſaid, was the very Root of the Evil, and that all labour was in vain till it were pulled up.</hi>

            <p>Not long after this, the King was prevailed

            <p>Tho' the Members of the Parliament knew the King was brought thither to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive them of their Liberty;
<note place="margin">Yet ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained their Freedom at the Price of their Lives.</note> yet there were ſome who reſolved to retain their ancient Freedom at the price of their Lives; and having declaimed againſt the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> and its ill Cuſtomes, which had degenerated into moſt pernicious Errors, and given occaſion to the riſe of many Sects; they thence infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, That the Penalties of Hereſie were to be mitigated, and the Severities of the Law abated, till the differences of Religion were compoſed by the Authority of a General Council, and the Diſcipline of the Church reformed. And this was the Opinion of all the good Men in the Parliament. <hi>Arnold du Ferrier,</hi> Preſident of the Criminal Court, an honeſt and a wiſe Perſon, and the beſt Lawyer in <hi>France,</hi> was the firſt who propoſed this Method, and was followed by many others, among which was <hi>Lewis du Faur,</hi> a Man of great Senſe, and of a generous Temper, who added, <hi>That all were agreed that the Differences in Religion had occaſioned great Diſturban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but then</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>we ought carefully to enquire, Who cauſed theſe Diſorders, leſt as</hi> Elijah <hi>anſwered</hi> Ahab, <hi>when he reproached him, as the Troubler of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>it might be ſaid to us;</hi> It is thou that haſt troubled Iſrael. Then <hi>Anna du Bourg</hi> beginning with a Diſcourſe of the Eternal Providence of God, to which all things are ſubject; when he came to the Queſtion propoſed, ſaid, There were many Sins and Crimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by Men, which the Laws had already forbidden, and yet the Gallows and Tortures which were imployed, had not been able to prevent the frequent Perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Adulteries, profuſe Luſts, and Profane Oaths, which were not only connived at, but cheriſhed. On the contrary, every Day new puniſhments are invented againſt a ſort of Men, who could never yet be convicted of any wicked Attempt; for how can they injure the Prince, who never name him but in their Prayers for him? Are they accuſed of breaking our Laws, perverting the Allegiance of our Cities or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces? No, the greateſt Tortures could never extort a Confeſſion that they ſo much as thought of any ſuch thing. Are they not accuſed of Sedition only, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have by the Candle of Scripture diſcovered the ſhameful and encreaſing Villanies and corruptions of the Roman Power, which they defire may be reformed? <hi>Chriſtopher Harlay</hi> and <hi>Peter Seguier</hi> the two Preſidents ſaid with great Modeſty, that the Court had hitherto juſtly and rightly diſcharged its Duty in this Particular, and that it would ſtill do the ſame without changing, to the Glory of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neither the King nor People of <hi>France</hi> would have cauſe to repent the truſting to it. <hi>Chriſtopher de Thou,</hi> with great freedom reflected on the King's Attorney and Advocates, for preſuming to defame the Proceedings of that Court, and indanger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its Authority. <hi>Renatus Baillet</hi> deſired the Judgments which were blamed, might be re-examined, and more maturely conſidered. <hi>Minart</hi> having made a ſhort Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, to ſoften the Envy which had been raiſed againſt them, only added, That he thought the King's Edicts were to be obſerved. After theſe <hi>Maiſtre</hi> the Preſident made a ſharp Harangue againſt the Sectaries, inſtancing in the Severities which <hi>Philip</hi> the Auguſt is ſaid to have employed againſt the <hi>Albingenſes,</hi> 600 of which he burnt in one day; and in the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> which were maſſacred with Fire and Smoak, partly in their Houſes, and partly in the Dens and Caves they had fled to.</p>
            <p>The King having obliquely reproached the Court for entring upon this Debate,
<note place="margin">The King's Anſwer.</note> without his Order, added, <hi>He now clearly ſaw, what he had heard before, That there were ſome among them, who deſpiſed both his Authority and the Popes. That this was the fault of but a few, but it was diſhonourable to the whole body of them; but only they that were guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhould ſuffer the Puniſhment. And therefore he exhorted the rest to go on in their Duty.</hi> The Reflections of <hi>la Faur</hi> and <hi>du Bourg,</hi> who mentioned the Story of <hi>Ahab,</hi> and the frequent Adulteries, exaſperated the King more than the reſt, and therefore he commanded <hi>Montmorancy</hi> to apprehend them, who again ordered <hi>Gabriel de Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomery,</hi> a Captain of the Guard, to take them and carry them to the <hi>Baſtile.</hi> After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Paul de Foix, Anthony Fumee, Euſtace de la Porte,</hi> were alſo taken into Cuſtody, but la <hi>Ferriere, du Val</hi> and <hi>Viole</hi> were concealed by their Friends, and eſcaped this Storm. Men cenſured theſe Proceedings, as they ſtood affected; but the Wiſer were much diſguſted, That the King ſhould be ſo far impoſed on by others, as to come perſonally into his Court to ſubvert thoſe Laws he ought to have protected: That he ſhould make uſe of Threats and Impriſonments; ſaying, That this was a clear Inſtance that he was ſubject to the Paſſions of others, and who could think but theſe things were the forerunners of great Changes?

                  <hi>Henry</hi> II, of <hi>France</hi> ſlain.</note> he received a Wound in the Eye, and falling from his Horſe was latched by ſome of his Servants, and carried into a Tower belonging to the <hi>Baſtile. It is ſaid, whilſt they carried him thither, he looked up, and remembring the Members of Parliament which he had committed there, ſaid; He feared he had done wrong to thoſe Innocent Men. The Cardinal of</hi> Lorrain, who was preſent, angry at it, reply'd; <hi>That Thought was put into his Mind by the Devil, the Enemy of Mankind: That he ought to be careful of his Motions, and continue constant in his Faith.</hi> Whether this were ſo or no, I will not affirm, (ſaith <hi>Thuanus,</hi> my Author) becauſe I am reſolved to write nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out good Authority: The Phyſicians ſaying too, That in theſe kinds of Wounds the Speech is loſt. At the Report of this Accident <hi>Andrew Veſale,</hi> a Famous Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian was preſently ſent from <hi>Bruſſels</hi> by King <hi>Philip,</hi> that he might however ſhew his Good-will to this Prince: But he came too late, the King dying <hi>July</hi> 2. when he had lived forty Years, three Months and eleven Days, and reigned twelve Years and three Months. The Marriage between <hi>Margaret</hi> his Siſter and <hi>Philbert</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> was hereupon haſted, that it might be finiſhed before his Death, and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated it was without any Pomp or Magnificence.</p>
            <p>There was great variety of Opinions, ſome extolling his Life beyond Reaſon,
<note place="margin">The various Characters of <hi>Henry</hi> II, of <hi>France.</hi>
               </note> as Martial and Brave, and his Conqueſts, by which he had enlarged his Kingdom, add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it a great part of <hi>Italy, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Corſica:</hi> That having obtained a Victory againſt <hi>Charles</hi> V, at <hi>Renty,</hi> he had reduced that Great Prince to the Thoughts of a Retreat to a Private Life. That out of his rare Reſpect to the Church of <hi>Rome, (not regarding his Oath)</hi> he had renewed the War and ſuccoured <hi>Paul</hi> IV. That recalling his Army out of <hi>Italy,</hi> he had been able to defend <hi>France</hi> againſt the united Forces of King <hi>Philip,</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and at laſt had ended the War, at leaſt by an uſeful Treaty; and by the Marriages of his Daughter and Siſter, had ſecured the Publick Peace. Others ſaid he had violated the Glory of his Juſt Arms by breaking the Truce, and involved himſelf (by the Fault of others) in an unjuſt and unproſperous War, ſpent vaſt Treaſures, and loſt the Flower of his Kingdom: That the Peace was Deſirable, but very Diſhonourable; and the Marriage only a Covering for the infamy of the Conceſſions: And that as he delighted too much in War, ſo he periſhed diſhonourably like a common Soldier: His <hi>Miſſes,</hi> who reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rather than he, his Prodigality and Luxury were not forgotten: And the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of <hi>Poets</hi> then in <hi>France,</hi> was taken for an Inſtance of the Corruptions of the Times.</p>
            <p>To ſpeak freely without Love or Hatred, he was a Warlike Prince, and too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle affected to the Arts of Peace; but then he was ſoft and eaſie, and governed too much by others. Wiſe Men then thought there would follow a War, his Children being very yong, his Wife Ambitious, and the Court divided by Faction: And this accordingly came to paſs, and brought forty Years of great Calamity upon <hi>France.</hi> But I ſhall for the future be very ſhort in the French Affairs, referring the Reader to <hi>Davila,</hi> and other Writers, of the Civil Wars of <hi>France.</hi> The Reader may be pleaſed to know, That I have in all this followed <hi>Thuanus,</hi> abridging him in ſome Places, and in others tranſcribing him at large.</p>

Andre,</hi> and <hi>Anthony de Mouchy</hi> againſt the reſt of the People; who, that they might ſpread the terror of their Names over the whole Nation, thought fit to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with <hi>Paris.</hi> Their principal Blood-hounds were <hi>Ruſſanges,</hi> and <hi>Claude David,</hi> two Mechanicks, and one <hi>George Renard,</hi> a Taylor, who had all three profeſſed the Reformed Religion; and were now imployed, as beſt acquainted with theſe Men. They drew in two Apprentices ſhortly after, who had deſerted their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters: And theſe, to gain the greater Applauſe,
<note place="margin">Slaunders againſt the Proteſtants.</note> confeſſed not only that they had Nocturnal Meeting, but (which ſaith <hi>Thuanus,</hi> was a notorious Lie) that they at them uſed promiſcuous Conjunctions after the Candles were put out. And this Impudent Story created a great Deteſtation of the Proteſtants, in the Minds of the deluded Catholicks, whoſe Ears were open to theſe kinds of Miſrepreſentations. This lye was carried on with great Induſtry, and theſe two Wretches were led firſt to the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and then to the Queen, to communicate this rare Secret,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51585:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>no Man daring to contradict it. The Queen, who was never a Friend to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, from henceforth was more than ever enraged againſt them: But <hi>Oliver,</hi> the Chancellor, ſuſpecting the Story, examined theſe Lads ſeparately, and by their Varying and Contradicting each other, found it to be a mere Lye. But when it was diſcovered ſo to be, they went unpuniſhed, the Hatred againſt the Sectaries drowning the Voice of Publick Juſtice.</p>
            <p>However, the Places of Meeting being thus diſcovered, great Numbers of Men and Women were taken and impriſoned, and others left the Kingdom, whoſe Goods were ſeized and confiſcated. Many Children were left by their Parents, which filled the Streets with their Cries and Lamentations, to the great Affliction of almoſt all Men. This Example was ſoon after followed at <hi>Poictiers, Toloſe, Aix,</hi> and generally in the Province of <hi>Narbonne, George d' Armagnac,</hi> the Archbiſhop of that See, a Cardinal, imploying all his Intereſt and Induſtry, that the ſuſpected might be taken up. They were by this time become ſo numerous, that their very Number gave them Boldneſs, which being thus exaſperated, vented it ſelf in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Reflections on the King, Queen and <hi>Guiſes;</hi> in which there ſeemed to be more than a private Anger and Liberty.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>France</hi> had been a long time afflicted with a tedious Quartane Ague,
<note place="margin">Other Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſpread againſt the poor perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants.</note> but overgrowing that Diſeaſe, he ſhot up in heighth, and grew apace, but was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Pale, and of a ſickly Conſtitution; being removed to <hi>Blois,</hi> which was his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Air, his Face of a ſudden was overſpread with Redneſs, Spots and Carbuncles, whereupon a Report was raiſed, That he had the Leproſie, and that a great number of Children, of leſs than ſix Years of Age, had been torn out of the Arms of their Mothers about the <hi>Loire,</hi> to make a Bath of their Blood for the Cure of the King. It was uncertain whether the <hi>Guiſes</hi> or their Enemies had invented this Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for different Ends; but the Blame of it was certainly caſt upon the Proteſtants, and the King by that means was exaſperated againſt them by the <hi>Guiſes.</hi> The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, on the other ſide, put out a Book, to ſhew that this Story was invented and fathered on them by the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain.</hi> And after this one of the Spreaders of this Report being executed for it, averred with his laſt Breath, That he had Orders from the Cardinal ſo to do.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Proceſs was carried warmly on,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Du Bourg</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to Death.</note> againſt <hi>Anna du Bourg,</hi> and the reſt of the Members of the Parliament, who were Priſoners in the <hi>Bastile;</hi> who were ſent thither by the Orders of <hi>Henry</hi> II. <hi>Du Bourg</hi> had appealed firſt to the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> and after to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Sens;</hi> but his Plea was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled by both, and the Sentence of the Biſhop of <hi>Paris</hi> was alſo confirmed by the Archbiſhop of <hi>Lions.</hi> He declared himſelf willing, after this to be degraded, <hi>That the Sign of the Beaſt in the</hi> Revelation <hi>being blotted out, he might have nothing of Antichriſt left in him:</hi> However, this variety of Appeals prolonged their Proceſs ſome Months. After this he ſent them a plain Confeſſion of his Faith, which agreed in all things with that of <hi>Geneva. Frederick</hi> Elector, and Count Palatine of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> alſo ſo far eſpouſed his Cauſe, as to write a Letter to the King in his behalf; deſiring his Life might be ſpared, and that he might be ſent to him. <hi>December</hi> 18. <hi>Anthony Minart</hi> the Preſident was ſhot dead,

                     <hi>Du Bourg</hi> led to Execution.</note> and taking his Leave of them ſaid, He went willingly to the Stake.</hi> From thence he was carried in a Cart to the Place of Execution, and having ſpoken a few Words to the People, was firſt hanged and afterwards burnt. He only ſaid, <hi>My God forſake me not, that I may not forſake thee.</hi> He was 38 Years old, and was born at <hi>Riom</hi> in <hi>Auvergne,</hi> of a Rich and Noble Family, <hi>Anthony du Bourg,</hi> a Branch of which had been Chancellor of <hi>France</hi> under <hi>Francis</hi> I.

<note place="margin">The reſt of the Members of Parliament were reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> His Conſtancy partly confirmed and partly exaſperated the Minds of the Proteſtants; <hi>ſo that from his Aſhes there ſprung up a Crop of Rebellions and Conſpiracies, which for a long time kept this once moſt flouriſhing Kingdom in a low condition.</hi> The reſt of the Members were reſtored, by the Court at laſt; <hi>de Thou,</hi> one of the Members

The Queen Regent thereupon ordered all the Miniſters, who were come as far as that City, but attended by vaſt Numbers of the Nobility, Gentry and Commons, in order to their appearing in the Parliament, to return Home, ſaying; <hi>She would not proceed in the Citation;</hi> yet afterward ſhe declared them Rebels for not appearing. This made many leave her and go over to the Proteſtants.

When in this no body would obey her, one <hi>Areskin</hi> of <hi>Dundee</hi> went over to them, and aſſured them, The Regent was ſo exaſperated, that there was nothing but Ruine to be hoped for at her Hands; and that ſhe had no regard to her Promiſe: Thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they all reſolved to diſſemble no longer with her, but to <hi>uſe Force against Force.</hi> One <hi>John Knox,</hi> a bold and violent Preacher, further inflamed their over-heated Minds by a Seditious Sermon. The Nobility going to Dinner from the Sermon, a Quarrel aroſe in the Church, and the Prieſt that interpoſed being ſeverely treated, the Rabble fell upon the Statues and Altars, and deſtroy'd them in a moment; after this, they fell upon the <hi>Franciſcan</hi> and <hi>Dominican</hi> Abbeys, where they alſo deſtroy'd the Images and Altars.

            <p>The Regent was by this time as much incenſed as they; and ſwore, <hi>She would revenge this Villany with the Blood of the Inhabitants, and the Ruin of the Town.</hi> But in the <hi>interim</hi> the Example ſpread, and the ſame things were reacted at <hi>Cupre</hi> in <hi>Fife.</hi> The Regent having aſſembled ſome Forces under <hi>Hamilton</hi> Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Athole,</hi> marched eaſily towards St. <hi>John</hi>'s-<hi>Town,</hi> that the Cannon might over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take them.

And ſhortly after they had Seven thouſand Men in Arms againſt her; ſo that ſhe now ſaw that Force would not do; upon which ſhe ſent the Lord <hi>James Steward</hi> Prior of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and one <hi>Cambell</hi> (who tho' <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi> continued in their Obedience to her) to treat with the Earl of <hi>Glencarne</hi> and <hi>Areskin,</hi> who agreed, <hi>May</hi> 29, <hi>That all Forces being diſcharged, the Town ſhould be ſet open to the Regent, that ſhe might refreſh her ſelf a few days in it: That no</hi> French <hi>ſhould yet enter into it, nor come near it by three Miles: That all other Controverſies ſhould be determined in the next Parliament.</hi> Whereupon ſhe entred the Town, and was honourably received. But one of the Inhabitants being ſlain by an inſolent Soldier, and the Regent expreſſing not any Concern for it; They from thence concluded the Treaty would not be long obſerved, and accordingly about three days after ſhe ordered the Town to be ſack'd, chang'd the Magiſtrates, and reſtoring the mercenary <hi>Scots,</hi> ſworn to and paid by the <hi>French.</hi> Being hereupon urged with her Promiſe, ſhe anſwer'd, <hi>That Promiſe was not to be kept with Hereticks, and if ſhe could make an honest Excuſe after the Fact committed, ſhe would take upon her Conſcience to kill and undo all that Sect;</hi> concluding, <hi>That Princes ought not to have their Promiſes ſo ſtrictly urged upon them;</hi> and then went back to <hi>Sterling.</hi> The Convenience and Strength of the Place, made her think it worth the breach of her Faith to them; but the Lord <hi>James Steward</hi> the Prior of St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> were ſo offended with this Procedure, that they left her, and went over to the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi> and gave them notice that ſhe intended to Garriſon <hi>Cupre</hi> and St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> in <hi>Fife,</hi> with <hi>Frenchmen.</hi> Whereupon they deſtroyed the <hi>Franciſcan</hi> and <hi>Dominican</hi> Abbies of the laſt City under the Archbiſhop's <hi>Eyes,</hi> yet he durſt not ſhew the leaſt diſcontent at it, but fled into <hi>Faulkland.</hi> The Regent aſſembled all the <hi>French</hi> ſhe had in the Kingdom, which were two thouſand, and one thouſand <hi>Scots,</hi> and march<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

By this time ſhe ſaw, to her Coſt, how neceſſary it was for Princes not to break their Faith. For when ſhe would have gladly come to Peace, there could no reliance be made upon her Promiſe, and ſhe had nothing elſe to engage. And when they demanded the <hi>French</hi> might be ſent away, ſhe ſaid that ſhe could not do it without order from the King of <hi>France.</hi> So ſhe was deſired to withdraw the Garriſon out of St. <hi>John</hi>'s-<hi>Town;</hi> which when ſhe refuſed, the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> marched thither the Twenty fourth of <hi>June,</hi> and in a few days took it. From thence they march'd to the Abbey of <hi>Scone,</hi> and took and ſack'd it; and being informed the Regent deſigned to put a <hi>French</hi> Garriſon into <hi>Sterling,</hi> they went in the night from St <hi>John's-Town</hi> thither, and ſurprized it, and ruined all the Monaſteries, Images and Altars. They alſo changed the Religion at <hi>Lithgo,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Linlithgow.</note> in the way to <hi>Sterling,</hi> and whereſoever they prevail'd. The Regent and the <hi>French</hi> in the mean time retired from <hi>Edinburg</hi> to <hi>Dunbar,</hi> expecting till this Storm ſhould blow over, and here they heard of the Death of <hi>Henry</hi> II of <hi>France:</hi> The <hi>Proteſtants</hi> rejoyced at it, as a thing that tended to their Safety, but had like to have made it the occaſion of their Ruine, by withdrawing from the Army. The Regent thereupon marched with her Forces to <hi>Edinburg,</hi> and in the way had a fair opportunity to have fought and overthrown the remainder of their Army, which was prevented by the Duke of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and <hi>James</hi> Earl of <hi>Dowglaſs.</hi> The Twenty fourth of <hi>July</hi> a Truce was made to laſt till the Tenth of <hi>January;</hi> which the Regent obſerved ſo much the more exactly, becauſe ſhe found by Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience that the former breach of Promiſe had involved her in greater Difficulties and Diſtreſſes. Yet even here ſhe could not totally lay aſide her old wont, but broke Faith as far as ſhe durſt.</p>

The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Embaſſador complain'd of this, but to no purpoſe, as tending to the great Injury of his Miſtreſs, with whom they had lately made a Peace, they having never done it in the Life of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> though there was a War between the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: That there were great numbers of Soldiers Liſted in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> to be Tranſported into <hi>Scotland</hi> upon the ſame Continent with <hi>England.</hi> So that Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had juſt reaſon to ſuſpect the Intentions of the <hi>French,</hi> who now breathed nothing but Blood and Death againſt the <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> but that Prince's Deſigns, whatever they were, periſhed with him, to the great Advantage of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> who had otherwiſe been attack'd by all the Forces of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> both as <hi>Illigitimate</hi> and an <hi>Heretick.</hi> Yet ſhe ordered his Exequies to be celebrated at St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s with great Solemnity, and by <hi>Charles</hi> Son to the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> of <hi>Effingham</hi> her Envoy, condol'd his Death, congratulated the Succeſſion of <hi>Francis</hi> his Son, and promis'd to obſerve the Peace between them religiouſly.</p>

            <p>Upon this the Council of <hi>England</hi> began to conſider in good earneſt, and with great Application of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Affairs, it was thought a thing of very ill and dangerous Example, that one Prince ſhould undertake the Protection of the Subjects of another Prince, who were in Rebellion: But then it was thought impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous not to aſſiſt thoſe of the ſame Religion, when perſecuted for it. And it was certainly a great Folly, to ſuffer the <hi>French,</hi> the ſworn Enemies of <hi>England,</hi> when they challenged the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> too, and were at Peace with all the reſt of the World, to continue armed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> which lay ſo near and convenient for the Invaſion of <hi>England,</hi> on that ſide which had the greateſt number of <hi>Roman</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, both of the Nobility and Commons. This was thought a betraying the Safety and Quiet of the whole Nation, in a very cowardly manner: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was concluded, It was no Time now for lazy Counſels; but that it was beſt to take up their Arms, and as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cuſtom was, To prevent their Enemies, and not ſtay till they ſhould begin with us. It was always as lawful to Prevent an Enemy as to repel him, and to defend our ſelves the ſame way that others Attack us. That <hi>England</hi> could never be Safe, but when it was Armed and Potent; and that nothing could contribute more to this End than the ſecuring it againſt <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> That in order to this the Proteſtants of <hi>Scotland</hi> were to be protected, and the <hi>French</hi> Forces driven out of it; and this was not to be done by Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but by Arms. That the neglect of theſe Methods had not long ſince loſt <hi>Calais,</hi> to our great Hindrance and Shame: That a little before, whilſt the <hi>French</hi> pretended to preſerve the Peace with great Fidelity, they had ſurprized the Fort of <hi>Ambleteul,</hi> and ſome other Places near <hi>Bologne,</hi> and by that means forced the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> to ſurrender that important Place. That we muſt expect the ſame Fate would attend <hi>Berwick,</hi> and the other Fronteer Garriſons, if they did not forthwith take Arms, and not rely any longer on the <hi>French</hi> Pretences of maintaining the Peace, which were never to be believed, their Counſels being ſecret, their Ambition boundleſs, and their Revenues immenſe; ſo that it was then a Proverb in <hi>England, France can neither be Poor nor Quiet three Years together:</hi> And Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was uſed to ſay that Expreſſion of <hi>Valentinean</hi> the Emperour was good,

            <p>The <hi>French</hi> in the <hi>interim</hi> were not idle, but the Regent reproach'd the <hi>Lords of the Congregation</hi> (ſo the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> were call'd) in a Proclamation, that they had brought <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> frequently into their Houſes, that came with Meſſages unto them, and returned Anſwers back to <hi>England;</hi> though they made no Anſwer to them, becauſe they did not think it convenient either to deny it, or openly to Avow it for the preſent; and the King of <hi>France</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary</hi> wrote each a diſtinct Letter to the Lord <hi>James Stewart,</hi> threatning him with Puniſhment as his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs deſerved, and by Word of Mouth let him know, <hi>That he would rather loſe the Crown of</hi> France, <hi>than not be revenged on the Seditious Tumults raiſed in</hi> Scotland. And one <hi>Octavian,</hi> a French Captain, landed ſoon after with a French Regiment, great Sums of Mony and Ammunition of War, and was forthwith ſent back by the Regent for one hundred Horſe, and four Ships of War; and in the mean time ſhe fell to Fortifie <hi>Iſith</hi> or <hi>Leith,</hi> expelling all the former Inhabitants, and making it a Colony of French only, it being a Sea-Port-Town, fit to receive Supplies, and a Place that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:51585:21"/>might ſerve the French Companies for a Refuge, if they ſhould happen to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to any great ſtreight. This was done about <hi>September,</hi> as appears by a Letter of the Nobility about it in that Month.

            <p>The Lords retired firſt to <hi>Sterling,</hi> and then to <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> where they reform'd all things after their uſual manner; and in the mean time they ſent <hi>William Maitland</hi> and <hi>Robert Melvil</hi> to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> where at laſt they obtained what they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned in the manner I have expreſs'd.</p>

The Nineteenth of <hi>March, Renaudie</hi> met <hi>Pardaillan,</hi> who was ſent with a Party of Horſe to take up ſuch as he found in Arms. <hi>Pardaillan</hi> would have fired a Piſtol againſt <hi>Renaudie,</hi> but it miſſing, <hi>Renaudie</hi> run him through,

                  <hi>Renaudie</hi> ſlain.</note> but was ſlain in the ſame moment by <hi>Pardaillan</hi>'s Servant himſelf. His Body was brought to <hi>Ambois,</hi> and hang'd on a Gibbet, with this Inſcription, <hi>The Leader of the Rebels.</hi> Two of his Servants were taken at the ſame time, and ſome Papers in a private Character, which proved to be a Petition on the beſalf of the Proteſtants, deſigned to be preſented to the King in an Aſſembly of the States, Begging a Remiſſion of the Severity of the Laws againſt them, and Proteſting the utmoſt Duty and Obedience to him. Many of thoſe who were taken, were examin'd againſt the King of <hi>Navar,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde.</hi> Who ſaid, They knew nothing of <hi>Navar,</hi>

Some few were Tried for this Conſpiracy, but many more were Hang'd up by Night, and many Merchants were Slain as they travelled about their buſineſs for
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:51585:23"/>their Mony, but under Pretence they were in the Conſpiracy, ſo that there was nothing but Slaughter and Murthers to be ſeen.</p>
            <p>About the ſame time,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Oliver</hi> the Chancellor dies.</note> 
               <hi>Oliver</hi> the Chancellor of <hi>France</hi> died, not ſo much of Old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age or Sickneſs, as Diſcontent at the Cruelcy and Iniquity of the Times; his Death was foretold by ſome of the Conſpirators, who reproached him for his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Complyances. And when the Cardinal of <hi>Lorain</hi> viſited him in his laſt Sickneſs, he expreſs'd his Reſentments againſt him, and died weeping and ſighing for what he had done. <hi>Michel de l'Hoſpital,</hi> a great and a good Man, ſucceeded him, by the procurement of Queen <hi>Catherine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though this Conſpiracy was principally deſign'd againſt the <hi>Guiſes,</hi> yet they deſired the World ſhould believe theſe Men had firſt made a Defection from God by Hereſie, and then had conſpired againſt the King, Queen <hi>Catherine,</hi> and the King's Brothers: The Thirty firſt of <hi>March</hi> the King wrote to all the Governors of the ſeveral Provinces, to take great care that the Reliques of this Conſpiracy did not imbroil their Provinces; after which there was the like Account ſent to the Elector <hi>Palatine,</hi> and the reſt of the Proteſtant Princes of <hi>Germany.</hi> The Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> thereupon, among other things, <hi>deſired the King to conſider whether he had not yielded more than was fit to ſome about him</hi> (meaning the <hi>Guiſes) who out of an inbred Malice and Cruelty exerciſed great Cruelties on Men that were never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed of any Crime. There they beſeech his Majeſty, that he would put a ſtop to the Sufferings of theſe Innocents, and ſeeing they imbrace the ſame Religion with us, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but deſire an end may be put to thoſe cruel and haſty Executions. This</hi> Germany <hi>has found</hi> (ſay they) <hi>to be the only Remedy, and</hi> France <hi>has no other left to reſtore its Peace, than by granting a Peace to the Minds and Conſciences of Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Coligni</hi> the Admiral leaving the Court,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Coligni</hi> ſent into <hi>Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> by the Queen.</note> Queen <hi>Catherine</hi> ordered him to go into <hi>Normandy,</hi> and to enquire diligently into the Cauſes of the late Conſpiracy: He laid the blame of it on the boundleſs Ambition of the <hi>Guiſes,</hi> and adviſed the Queen to obſerve inviolably the late Edict for Liberty of Conſcience, and to put a ſtop to the Perſecution of the Innocent, as ſhe valued the ſafety of the King, and the quiet of the Kingdom. Some of the Captives who had eſcaped out of the Priſons at <hi>Blois,</hi> wrote Letters to the Cardinal of <hi>Lorain,</hi> telling him, they knew the Eſcape of the Conſpirators was very afflictive to his Eminence: That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were gone to ſeek them, and hoped in a ſhort time to return better attended. This rallery was a great Mortification to that fearful Miniſter, who feared new Commotions, and perſuaded the King to put out a General Pardon for all <hi>Roman Catholicks.</hi>

            <p>About this time <hi>Conde</hi> left the Court,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Conde</hi> leaves the Court.</note> and by a Letter gave his Brother the King of <hi>Navar</hi> an Account of the Ill-will the <hi>Guiſes</hi> bore towards him, and that a Debate had been held in the King's Cabinet-Council, for the taking him into Cuſtody: That therefore he had been forced to betake himſelf to him into <hi>Bearne.</hi> This Letter was ſoon after diſcovered to the <hi>Guiſes</hi> who had entertained Spies in the Family of <hi>Conde,</hi> who preſently wrote a Letter to <hi>Conde</hi> full of ſugared Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Kindneſs and Affection; which <hi>Conde</hi> preſently ſent to his Brother, who very much approved his Reſolution, but adviſed him to return to Court and clear his Innocence; which <hi>Conde</hi> did not think ſafe. <hi>Perrenot</hi> the Brother of Cardinal <hi>Granvell,</hi> in an Audience he had of Queen <hi>Catherine,</hi> told her, there was no way to reſtore the Peace of <hi>France,</hi> but by Baniſhing the <hi>Guiſes</hi> ſome time from Court, and Recalling the Princes of the Blood and <hi>Montmorancy</hi> to their former Stations.</p>
            <p>The Twenty firſt of <hi>August,</hi>

               </note> the Aſſembly of the Princes and Notable Men of <hi>France</hi> was Opened at <hi>Founain-bleau.</hi> The Chancellor in his Speech, among other things, complained, <hi>That the Hearts of the People of</hi> France <hi>were incenſed againſt the King and his Principal Miniſters, but the Cauſe of it was not known, and therefore it was ſo difficult to find out and apply a fitted Remedy. For That, the greateſt part of the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:51585:23"/>Men of this Kingdom being weary of what is preſent, fearful of what is to come, divided by different Religions, and deſirous of Change, are willing to imbroil the Kingdom. And therefore their principal Buſineſs was to find out the cauſe of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe, and apply a fitting Remedy to this Sickly Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Coligni</hi> the Admiral, who was preſent the next day,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Coligni</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Proteſtants to the King.</note> preſented a Petition to the King, which had been given him whilſt he was in <hi>Normandy,</hi> by a vaſt number of his Subjects; deſiring that the Severity of the Laws againſt them, might be mitigated, till their Cauſe had been duly conſidered and determined: That they might have Publick Places aſſigned them for the Exerciſe of their Religion, leſt their Private Meetings ſhould be ſuſpected by the Government: And they invoked God to bear Witneſs, That they had never entertained any diſloyal Thought againſt his Majeſty, nor would do ſo: But on the contrary they offered up to God, moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Prayers for the Preſervation and Peace of his Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Valence,</hi> a Learned, Grave and Experienced Perſon,
<note place="margin">The Biſhop of <hi>Valence</hi> ſeconds it.</note> confirmed this Opinion, ſhewing the great Corruptions in the Church had given Birth and promoted theſe Diviſions in the Minds of Men, which were rather exaſperated than extirpated by harſh means and bloody Perſecutions. Then he ſhewed the great Uſe of General Councils, for the compoſing the Differences in the Church:
<note place="margin">And adviſeth the King to call a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Council.</note> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſaid, <hi>He wondred how the Pope could quiet his Conſcience one Hour, whilſt he ſaw ſo many thouſand Souls periſh, which God, without doubt, would require at his Hands. But if</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>a General Council cannot be had, the King ought to follow the Examples of</hi> Charles <hi>the Great, and S.</hi> Lewis <hi>his Anceſtors, and call a National Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of</hi> France; <hi>commanding the Teachers of the Sectaries to be preſent in it, and to enter into Conference with the Divines, concerning the Points in Controverſie,</hi> &amp;c. That the Sectaries were worthy of Blame for their Rebellion, and the Roman Catholicks for having been too Bloody and Cruel in the Proſecution of them; which had only ſerved to irritate the Minds of Men, and make them enquire more greedily into the Opinions of thoſe they ſaw ſuffer ſo patiently. That the ancient Fathers im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed no other Arms againſt the Arians, Macedonians and Neſtorians, but the <hi>Word of God,</hi> and the Princes then did only baniſh Hereticks.</p>
            <p>The Archbiſhop of <hi>Vienne</hi> repreſented the great Difficulties that hindred the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a General Council; <hi>For</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>there is none of us who doth not know what great pains</hi> Charles <hi>V, took to procure a General Council, and what Arts and Stratagems the Poples imployed to defeat that commendable hope this pious Prince had entertained. The Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is of too acute a Nature to attend long Delays, which are very uncertain; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the beſt way was to call a National Council; which the King had already promiſed, and the urgent Neceſſities of the Church would not ſuffer him to delay any longer.</hi> Having ſhewn how this had been conſtantly practiſed from the Times of <hi>Clovis</hi> to <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, and ſo downward to the times of <hi>Charles</hi> VIII. He concluded, <hi>That the Neceſſity being Great, they ought to delay no longer, nor to regard the Oppoſitions the Pope would make against this Method.</hi> For the appeaſing the Civil Diſſentions of <hi>France,</hi> he adviſed the calling an Aſſembly of the three Eſtates.</p>
            <p>The third day <hi>Coligni</hi> diſcourſed of the Petition he had preſented; and being asked, why it was not ſubſcribed? He ſaid, There was above fifty thouſand Men, in the Nation, ready to ſubſcribe it: Concluding, <hi>That there was nothing more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitous, than for a Prince to fear his Subjects: And they to be at the ſame time afraid of him. That the Houſe of God</hi> (the Church) <hi>was to be forthwith reformed, the Army to be diſhanded, and an Aſſembly of the three Eſtates called as ſoon as might be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> was ſo inraged with <hi>Coligni</hi>'s Speech,
<note place="margin">The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> replies to <hi>Coligni.</hi>
               </note> that he made a ſudden reply to it. <hi>That the whole ſcope of ill Men was to deprive the King of his mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Guards, that they might the more eaſily oppreſs him. That the late Conſpiracy was againſt the King, and not against his Miniſters, as was pretended: That as to what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned Religion, he would ſubmit to Learned Men: But then he protested, That no Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils ſhould be of that Authority with him, as to depart in any thing from the Customs of his Ancestors; and eſpecially in the moſt ſacred Myſtery of the Lord's Supper: And as to an Aſſembly of the States, he ſubmitted that intirely to the King.</hi> He concluded, The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries were a Seditious, Proud ſort of Men, and that <hi>the Goſpel and Faith of Chriſt was made an occaſion of Tumults and Seditions by them, and therefore they were to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely proſecuted.</hi> Yet he was for mitigating the Severity of the Laws towards ſuch, as met peaceably without Arms, who were to be reduced to their Duty by more gentle Methods, more than by Force. <hi>To which purpoſe he would freely ſpend his Life. That the Biſhops and Curates ſhould by their preſence redeem the Time they had loſt,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:51585:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>and the Governours of the Provinces be forced to do their Duties. But then, ſince there was nothing under Debate, but want of Diſcipline, and Corruption of Manners, it ſeemed very unneceſſary, that either a General or a National Council ſhould be called.</hi> The free Confeſſion of this Cardinal, is the Opinion of the whole Party; and though the name of a General Council makes a great noiſe, yet we very well know how they have treated the ancienteſt and beſt Councils, when they have in any thing croſſed their Humors or Intereſts, and from thence may conclude, They will never ſubmit to any that ſhall not be conformable to their Wills.</p>
            <p>The twenty ſixth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A Decree paſſed for an Aſſembly of the three Eſtates, and the ſuſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Laws againſt Hereticks. A deſign up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Lyons.</hi>

And in the mean time all Severities in matters of Religion ſhould be omitted. <hi>Thus</hi> (ſaith <hi>Thuanus,</hi> my Author) <hi>the Proteſtant Religion, which before was ſo much hated, began by degrees to grow up and get Strength with the tacit Conſent of its greateſt Enemies.</hi> Thus ended the Aſſembly of the Princes, and Notable Men of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About this time <hi>Ferrieres Maligni,</hi> one of the Conſpirators of <hi>Amboiſe,</hi> eſcaping out of Priſon, had a Deſign to ſurprize <hi>Lyons,</hi> and had formed ſo great a Party in the Town, as might have done it, but remitting the execution of his Project to a more convenient time, by order of the King of <hi>Navarr,</hi> the thing was diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and many of his Partizans taken; but yet ſuch was the conſtancy of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that though many were tortured, yet nothing could be found out to prove the King of <hi>Navarr</hi> or Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> concerned in this Attempt. Yet were they invited to Court by the King, to purge themſelves of the Suſpicion, upon a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe they ſhould receive no Injury: But this they wiſely refuſed as not Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
            <p>This and ſeveral other ſuch alarms procured an Edict, <hi>That no Prince or other perſon, of what condition ſoever, ſhould provide Money, Soldiers, Arms or Horſes; and if any Perſon did otherwiſe, it ſhould be taken for High-Treaſon.</hi> The Cardinal of <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,</hi> was alſo imployed to bring the Princes of his Family to Court, by paſſing his Faith to them, That nothing ſhould be done againſt them. The three Eſtates, in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim, meeting at <hi>Meaux,</hi> were from thence adjourned to <hi>Orleans,</hi> and the Marſhal <hi>de Thermes</hi> was ſent to <hi>Poictiers,</hi> with two hundred Horſe, to watch the Motions of the King of <hi>Navar,</hi> if he came to the Aſſembly.</p>

Perceiving by this the head-long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haſt of the <hi>Guiſes,</hi> his Lady delivered a Petition to the King, for learned Council, which was granted him: But his Servants were taken from him, and he was denied a Conference with his Brother of <hi>Navarr</hi> and the Cardinal, though he deſired ſome of the Kings Miniſters might be preſent. Theſe Hardſhips created him much Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion in the Minds of Men, and they thought he was hardly uſed, which made his Enemies yet more hated.

And to that end he had perſuaded the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> to make a War upon the <hi>Vaudois</hi> his Subjects. Whilſt the Pope was in this incertainty, in <hi>October</hi> the Duke of <hi>Florence</hi> came to <hi>Rome;</hi> and perſuaded the Pope by his Arguments to reſolve on the calling of a Council the next Year, that he might provide a General Remedy for a General Diſeaſe: He ſhewed him, That there was no Danger ſuch a Council would paſs any ſevere Sentence on the Manners and Abuſes of the Court of <hi>Rome:</hi> And that it was fit he ſhould deſire the Diſcipline and Corrupt Manners of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould be reformed: That he ought ſincerely to promote it,

            <p>The Pope thereupon ſent <hi>Lawrence Lenzi,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Firmo,</hi> to King <hi>Philip;

            <p>The Pope at the ſame time appointed <hi>Hercules Gonzaga, Hierome Seripand,</hi> and <hi>Staniſlaws Hoſio,</hi> three of his Cardinals, to be his Legates in the Council; and ſent <hi>Zachary Delfino</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Zant,</hi> and <hi>Francis Commendone,</hi> into <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> to invite the Proteſtant Princes to it. <hi>Canobbio</hi> was ſent into <hi>Poland</hi> on the ſame Errant; and had Orders to go on into <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> to exhort that Prince, who was of the <hi>Greek</hi> Communion, to ſend his Biſhops and Divines to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; but there being a War between the <hi>Ruſs</hi> and <hi>Poles</hi> at this time, this Journey was prevented.</p>

               </gap>tted by the ſudden Death of <hi>Fracis</hi> II. But there being great Diſcontents at the numerous Aſſemblies of the Proteſtants in many Places, which were now openly held; the finding out a Remedy for this, haſtned the opening that Convention. The Thirteenth of <hi>December</hi> was appointed for that Purpoſe, and the Chancellor began the Affair with an Elegant and Pious Diſcourſe. In which having ſhewn the Uſe of theſe Aſſemblies, and exhorted all degrees to Peace and Concord, and ſhewn 'em the common Cauſes of Sedition and Rebellion, he tells them, <q>That in their times, a new Cauſe, that of <hi>Religion,</hi> had been added to all the former; As if (ſaith he) <hi>Religion</hi> could or ought to be the cauſe of a Civil War, which is the greateſt Miſchief that can befall a Kingdom, and contains all others in it. But then God is not the Author of Diſſention, but of Peace; and other Religions, becauſe falſe, may be founded and preſerved by Force and Fraud; but the Chriſtian Religion, which is the only true, is only to be eſtabliſhed by Patience, Juſtice, Prayers and Tears: The ancient Chriſtians accordingly choſe rather to be Kill'd than to Kill, and Signed the Truth of their Religion with their Bloods: And yet it cannot be denied but that a falſe Religion is a very powerful Exciter of the Minds of Men, and ſurmounts all other Paſſions, and unites Men more ſtrongly than any other thing; ſo that we muſt confeſs that Kingdoms are divided in effect more by their Religions, than by their Bounds; and therefore it daily happens, that thoſe that are poſſeſs'd by an Opinion of Religion, have little regard to their Prince, their Country, Wives and Children; and from hence ſprings Rebellions, Diſſentions and Revolts. And in the ſame Houſe, if they are divided in Religion, the Husband cannot agree with the Wife and Children, nor one Brother with another. That therefore a Remedy might be had for ſo great a Calamity, it had been decreed at <hi>Fountain-bleau,</hi> That there was need of a Council, and the Pope having ſince declared there ſhould ſuddenly be one, that Men ought not in the mean time to hammer ont for themſelves new Religions, Rites and Ceremonies, according to their own Fancies. For this would not only endanger the publick Peace, but the Salvation of their Souls too. That if the Pope and the Council fail'd, the King would take the ſame Care his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors had, and provide for the Peace and Welfare of his Kingdom: That it was to be hoped the Biſhops would for the future exerciſe their Functions with greater Care and Diligence: That the Cure might come from that Fountain which had cauſed the Diſtemper: That they ought to arm themſelves with Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, Good Manners, and the Word of God, which are the Arms of Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants, and then go out to War againſt our Enemies, and not imitate unskilful Captains, who disfurniſh their Walls to make an Irruption. The Diſcourſe of one that lives well, is very perſuaſive, but the Sword has no other power over the Soul than to deſtroy it with the Body. Our Anceſtors overcame their Sectaries with their Piety, and we ought to imitate them if we would not be thought rather to hate the Men than their Vices. Let us therefore, ſaid he, pray daily for them, that they may be reduced from their Errors, and diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hateful Names of <hi>Lutherans, Huguenots</hi> and <hi>Papiſts,</hi> which were intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the Enemy of Mankind, and are too like the ancient Factions of <hi>Guelfs</hi> and <hi>Gibellins,</hi> let us only retain the Ancient Appellation of <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> But then, becauſe there are many who only pretend Religion, but are in Truth led by Ambition, Avarice and Novelty, it is fit to ſuppreſs theſe Men in the

The Cardinal of <hi>Lorraine</hi> had deſign'd in the former Reign to make a Speech in the Name of the three Eſtates; which was then not oppoſed, but now the Commons would not ſuffer it, becauſe contrary to the Ancient Uſage: And for that they had ſome things to object againſt the Cardinal him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>

That the Preaching of the Word of God, which was the chief cauſe of the inſtituting Biſhops, was totally neglected; and they thought it a ſhameful thing, and beneath their Dignity: And by their Example, the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates had learned to neglect their Duty too, and had ordered the Maſs to be ſung by Illiterate and Unworthy <hi>Stipendaries.</hi> That the exceſſive Pomp and Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice of the Clergy (who pretended by it to promote the Glory of God) had raiſed an Envy and an hatred of them in the Minds of the People.

That the Inſolence of the Sectaries was no longer to be endured, who deſpiſing the Authority of the Ancients, and the Doctrine received by the Church, would be thought alone to underſtand and imbrace the Goſpel.

He deſired that all Commerce between them and the Catholicks might be forbidden, and that they might be treated like Enemies, and that thoſe who were gone out of the Kingdom on the account of Religion, might be baniſhed. That it was the King's Duty to draw the Civil Sword, and put all thoſe to Death, who were infected with Hereſie; to defend the Clergy, and reſtore the Elections of Biſhops to the Chapters, the want of which had cauſed great Damages to the Church. That it had been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, That the very Year the Pope granted the King the Nomination of Biſhops, this Schiſm began, and has ever ſince ſpread it ſelf; for in the 1517, <hi>Luther, Zuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glius</hi> and <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> ſet up, and <hi>Calvin</hi> followed them. This Speech incenſed the whole Aſſembly againſt him, and eſpecially the Proteſtants, who publiſhed ſo many Libels and Satyrs againſt him, that he ſoon after died of Shame and Grief.

            <p>After ſome days, the King Signified to the Biſhops, that they ſhould prepare themſelves for the Council, which was now recall'd at <hi>Trent;</hi> and the Judges and Prefects were commanded to diſcharge all that were Impriſon'd for Religion only, and leave all that were ſuſpected, the free injoyment of their Eſtates and Goods; And it was made Capital to reproach, or injure one the other, on the Account of Religion.

<note place="margin">The Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> which Occaſioneth a War.</note> Speronus</hi> and <hi>Arnaldus,</hi> made a defection from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and had at times been ſeverely treated for it, by the French, under whom they had been; but by the laſt Treaty were aſſigned to the Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi> This People about the Year 1555, had imbraced the Reformation, and had ſuffered it to be publickly preached, tho it was forbidden by the Council at <hi>Turin,</hi> which the Year following ſent one of its own Members, to inquire after the Offenders and to puniſh them; to whom the Inhabitants of this Valley delivered the Confeſſion of their Faith; <q>Declaring that they profeſs'd the Doctrin contained in the Old and New Teſtament, and comprehended in the Apoſtles Creed; and admitted the Sacraments Inſtituted by Chriſt; the IV firſt Councils, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe of <hi>Nice, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, Epheſus,</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon;</hi> and the Ten Commandments &amp;c. That they believed the Supreme civil Magiſtrates were Inſtituted by God, and they were to be obeyed, and that who ſoever reſiſted them, ſought againſt God. They ſaid they had received this Doctrin from their Anceſtors, and that if they were in any error they were ready to receive inſtruction from the Word of God, and would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently renounce any heretical or erroneous Doctrin which ſhould be ſo ſhewen to them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thereupon a Solemn Diſpute was in ſhew, appointed concerning the Sacrifice of the Maſs, Auricular Confeſſion, Tradition, Prayers and Oblations for the Dead, and the Ceremonies of the Church and her Cenſures; all which were rejected by them, they alledging that they were humane Inventions, and contrary to the Word of God. This Confeſſion was ſent by the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> to the King of <hi>France,</hi> who about a year after return'd Anſwer, That he had cauſed it to be Examin'd by his lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Divines; who had all condemn'd it as Erroneous and contrary to true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and therefore the King commanded them to reject this Confeſſion and to Submit to the Holy Church of Rome; and if they did not do ſo, their Perſons and Eſtates ſhould be Confiſcated. But they on the contrary were reſolved to ſtand by their former Confeſſion. They were thereupon commanded not to admit any Teacher who was not ſent by the Archbiſhop of <hi>Turin,</hi> or the Council there; and that if any Teachers came among them from <hi>Geneva</hi> they ſhould diſcover or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend them, upon pain of Death, and loſs of all they had. For three years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, the people of this Perſwaſion were let alone and no way moleſted; but this Year the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> much againſt his will and Inclination, was drawn by the Pope to make a War upon them. In the begining of <hi>March, Jean de Carquignau,</hi> and one <hi>Mathurim</hi> and his Wife were taken and burnt; and ſeveral of the Neighbour Valleys were Plundred, ſeveral of the Inhabitants were put to death; and about Sixty ſent to the Gallies, and ſome recanted and profeſs'd the Roman Catholick Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. After this one <hi>Thomas Jacomel</hi> a <hi>Dominican,</hi> was ſent with one <hi>Turbis</hi> for his Aſſiſtant, who was a bloody man, to inquire diligently and ſeverely into all that were ſuſpected; but the Nobility interpoſing, there was no great Severity ſhewn. The Monks of the Abbey of <hi>Pignoral,</hi> which was ſeated in the Entry of the Valley, on the other ſide, kept a parcel of Souldiers in Pay; and trapping as many of theſe Poor Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as they could, as they paſſed to and fro, they uſed them very cruelly; and ſome others of the Nobility did the ſame thing; and a Sedition following upon it, they fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the poor Inhabitants One Thouſand ſix Hundred Crowns. Upon this a ſharp war inſued, which ended in the Ruine of the Aggreſſors of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Paſtor alſo of <hi>Peroſia,</hi> was taken and burnt with a ſlow, Fire with many of his Flock, and the Inhabitants were ſpoiled of all they had, and forced to flee to the Mountains. Being thus inraged with hard Uſages, in the Month of <hi>July,</hi> Fifty of them ſet upon One Hundred and Twenty Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers belonging to the Abbey of <hi>Pignoral,</hi> put them to flight, and flew the greateſt part of them; and about Four Hundred more of their party coming up,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:51585:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>they took the Abbey of <hi>Pignoral,</hi> and delivered all their people which were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned there. In <hi>October</hi> following News being brought that the Duke of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi> was ſending an Army to deſtroy them; <hi>They reſolved that it was not lawful to take Arms againſt their Prince, but that they would take what they could carry away, and betake themſelves to the Mountains, and there attend the good pleaſure of God, who never forſakes his own, and can turn the Hearts of Princes which way he pleaſeth.</hi> There was not one Man amongſt them who repined againſt this Decree. In after times they had Paſtors who taught them otherwiſe, and <hi>told them it was not their Prince, but the Pope that they reſiſted, and that they fought not for their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but for their Wives and Children.</hi> The ſecond of <hi>November</hi> the Forces of the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> entered their Borders, and the Soldiers attempting to get above them, they betook themſelves to their Slings, and maintained a Fight againſt them (though they were but few in number) the ſpace of a whole day, with no great loſs. At laſt the General finding they were not to be forced, gave them leave to Petition the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> 
               <q>That they might live in Peace, aſſuring him that nothing but utter ruin coald have forced them to take Arms againſt him: for which they humbly implored his Highneſs's Pardon, and begging the Liberty of their Conſciences, and that they might not be forced to ſubmit to the Traditions of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> but might, with his good leave, enjoy the Religion they had learned from their Anceſtors.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Petition was ſeconded by the Ducheſs of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who was a merciful Princeſs, a and had great Power over the Affections of the Duke. It being ever her judgment <hi>that this People were not to be ſo ſeverely uſed, who had not changed their Religion a few days agon, but had been in Poſſeſſion of it from their Anceſtors ſo many Ages.</hi> Upon this they were to be received to mercy; but the Soldiery fell upon them, when they ſuſpected nothing, and Plundered them three days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. The General ſeemed to be much concerned at this breach of Faith: yet after this they were fined eight thouſand Crowns, which they were forced to borrow on great Uſury, and they were alſo commanded to bring all their Arms into the Caſtles the Duke had Garriſoned in their Country. And at laſt they were commanded to eject all their Paſtors (which was granted with the tears of their People) that they might avoid the fury of the Soldiers. The General pretended not to be ſatisfied that their Paſtors were in good truth gone, and when they ſuffered them to ſearch their Houſes, the Soldiers Plundered them again, and then burnt their Town. There was one Town called <hi>Angrogne,</hi> in a Valley of the ſame name, the General pretended to ſhew them more favour, and agreed that they ſhould have one Paſtor left them: but they forced him alſo to flee into the Mountains afterwards, and Plundered his Houſe, and all his Neighbours, and then injoyned the <hi>Sindicks</hi> (who are their chief Magiſtrates) to find up, and bring in the Paſtor; threatning that otherwiſe they would burn and deſtroy the whole Territory; and when they had ſo done then they withdrew.</p>
            <p>In the mean time their Meſſengers were gone with the Petition, mentioned above, to the Duke to <hi>Vercelli,</hi> where they attended forty days before they could get Audience, and then they were forced to promiſe they would admit the Maſs, and when the Prince had upon theſe terms forgiven their taking Arms againſt him, they were commanded to ask Pardon too of the Popes <hi>Nuncio,</hi> which at laſt they did. During their abſence, the Inhabitants of <hi>Angrogne</hi> had ſuffered no Sermons but in private, that they might not exaſperate the Prince, or make the Affairs of their Deputies more difficult. But they reſolved when theſe were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned they would exerciſe their Religion openly, and not give any thing to the maintaining of the Soldiers, whether their Requeſt were granted or denied.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of <hi>January</hi> the Deputies returned,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1561</label> and when their Principals underſtood what had been done, they wrote to the reſt of the Valleys to give them an account of it; and deſired a publick Gonſultation or Diet. At which it was reſolved that they ſhould all joyn in a League to defend their Religion, which they believed was agreeable to the Word of God, profeſſing in the mean time to obey their Prince according to the Commandments of God, and that they would for the future make no Agreement, or Peace, but by a common Conſent, in which the freedom of their Religion ſhould be ſaved. Upon this they grew more Confident, refuſed the Conditions offered by the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and the promiſes made by their Deputies. And the next day they entered into the Church of <hi>Bobbi,</hi> in Arms, and broke down all the Images and Altars, and after a Sermon,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:51585:28"/>marching to <hi>Villar,</hi> where they intended to do the like, they met the Soldiers (who had heard what was done) going to Plunder <hi>Bobbi,</hi> ſtopped them, and with their Slings ſo pelted them, that they were glad to ſhift for their lives, and left theſe Reformers to do the ſame thing at <hi>Villar.</hi> The Captain of <hi>Turin</hi> attempting to ſtop this Rage was beaten, and the Dukes Officers were glad to ſeek to their Paſtors for a Paſport. After this they beat the Captain of <hi>Turin</hi> in a ſecond Fight. By this time the whole Army drew into the Field, and the Inhabitants of theſe Valleys not being able to reſiſt them, they burnt all their Towns and Houſes, and deſtroyed all the People they took. In theſe Broils <hi>Monteil,</hi> one of the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s Chief Officers, was ſlain by a Lad of eighteen years of age; and <hi>Truchet,</hi> another of them, by a Dwarf. The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> had ſent ſeven thouſand Soldiers to deſtroy this handful of Men; and yet ſuch was their Rage and Deſperation, and the Advantage of their Country, that they beat his Soldiers whereſoever they met them. And in all theſe Fights their Enemies obſerved that they had ſlain only fourteen of the Inhabitants, and thence concluded that God fought for them. So the <hi>Savoyards</hi> began to treat of a Peace, which at laſt was concluded to the Advantage of theſe poor deſpicable People. The Duke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the eight thouſand Crowns they were to pay by the former Treaty, and ſuffering them to enjoy the Liberty of their Religion: <hi>So that he got nothing by this War but loſs and ſhame, the ruin of his People on both ſides, and the deſolating of his Country.</hi>

The Queen, on the other ſide, told <hi>Montmorency, That ſhe counived at them for the preſent, that ſhe might the more eaſily elude the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of the King of</hi> Navarre, <hi>by ſeeming to comply with him. But then</hi> (ſhe ſaid) <hi>he and the other great Men of that Kingdom ought to oppoſe them, and to complain that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of their Anceſtors was every where violated and deſpiſed.</hi> She deſigned by this, Firſt, To divide the great Men in the Point of Religion. Secondly, To weaken the Intereſt of the King of <hi>Navarre.</hi> And thirdly, To preſerve the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in <hi>France.</hi> But <hi>Montmorency,</hi> who was her Inſtrument, deſigned only the laſt, yet he was very active in it. The Queen in the interim carried her diſſimulation ſo far, that ſhe ordered <hi>Jean de Monluc,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Valence,</hi> who was a great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourer of the Reformation, and no Enemy to the Proteſtants Doctrine, to Preach frequently at Court, and She and the King were ſometimes preſent at his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. He would ſometimes ſpeak very freely againſt the Corruptions that were in the Doctrine and Diſcipline of the Church, and obliquely tax the Papal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. The favour the Queen ſhewed to this Biſhop, made <hi>Montmorency</hi> ſuſpect that in her Heart ſhe had a kindneſs for the Proteſtant Party, and that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand ſhe and <hi>Navarre</hi> had one and the ſame deſign. And thereupon he deſerted her, and joyned with the <hi>Guiſes,</hi> his (till then) Mortal Enemies, the Ducheſs <hi>de Valentois</hi> procuring the Reconciliation. <hi>Magdalen</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> Wife to <hi>Montmorency,</hi> was alſo an implacable enemy to the Reformation, and hated <hi>Coligni</hi> the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral, for that and other cauſes, and therefore ſhe perpetually ſtimulated him againſt the Proteſtants.</p>

That if he rejected <hi>Conde, Coligni,</hi> and <hi>Rochefoucault,</hi> on the Account of Religion, he would deprive his Family of the affiſtance of three great Men, and perhaps the Queen would think never the better of him: therefore his advice to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was to ſit ſtill, and let <hi>Coligni,</hi> and the <hi>Guiſes</hi> fight it out, without taking part on either ſide, and in all probability <hi>Guiſe</hi> would be worſted; and he would become the Arbitrator of the two contending Religions. And in the mean time, it was moſt certain, there were many great Errors, by length of time crept in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church, which he ought not to defend, becauſe they were injurious to the Majeſty of God.</q> The good old Gentleman was much moved at this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice from his Son, but made no other anſwer to it, than That <hi>he certainly knew that if the Religion were changed, the Civil Government would be changed too. That he cared not what became of him, if his little Maſters did well, and the Actions of</hi> Henry II. <hi>might not be called in queſtion; who was a wife Prince, and his good Maſter.</hi> So he periſhed in his firſt reſolves, believing he was obliged to defend the Cauſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion againſt his beſt, and moſt ancient, and tried friends.</p>

<note place="margin">An Edict to reſtrain them.</note> This neceſſitated the Council to forbid all Reviling Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and all Tumults on the Accounts of Religion; And by it, all that had been baniſhed for Religion in the Reign of <hi>Francis</hi> II. were invited to return, and promiſed, they ſhould enjoy their Goods and Eſtates, if they would live like good Catholicks for the future, or otherwiſe might ſell them, and retire elſewhere; which was after oppoſed by the Parliament at <hi>Paris,</hi> but yet many returned on that account, and many that were in Priſon were diſcharged, ſo that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Party appeared numerous.

<note place="margin">The Three Eſtates of <hi>France</hi> Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at <hi>Pont-Oyſe.</hi>
               </note> the Agreement between the Queen Regent and the King of <hi>Navar</hi> was Confirm'd by the three Eſtates, which was very difficultly obtain'd by the later. This Aſſembly was opened at St. <hi>Germain,</hi> where <hi>James Bretagne d'Autum,</hi> who ſpoke for the Commons, declaiming ſharply againſt the Ignorance of the Prieſts, and the Corrupt Manners and Depraved Diſcipline of the Clergy, ſo that they were unfit to Lead or Inſtruct the People, but rather diſguſted and diſpleaſed them, doing all things for Hire, and nothing as their Duty, enſlaving themſelves to Pleaſures, and wallowing in Luxury and Idleneſs. To this he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned the Calamities which at preſent oppreſs'd <hi>France.</hi> He therefore moved the King to take away all their Juriſdiction, that he ſhould employ their over-great Riches to Pious Uſes, and call a National Council, which was the only preſent and certain Cure of thoſe Evils; That free Paſports ſhould be given to all that would come to it, and, that the King or ſome of the Princes of the Blood ſhould preſide in it, whilſt Buſineſs of Religion was debated; That the late Decree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Conventicles ſhould be no prejudice to thoſe of the Reformed Religion, who rejected the Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor any Preſcription as to length of time, <hi>which could not make what in it ſelf was falſe, true; and the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Religion was to be quietly and friendly debated according to the Word of God, and not with the Sword and Reproaches.</hi> He that ſpoke for the Nobility, excuſed the Clergy, and deſired the King to preſerve their Priviledges and Dignities. But then he moved, to have the greateſt part of the Church Lands ſold to pay the Debts of the Crown, pretending, that a third part of the Parchaſe Money put out to Uſe, would be as good to them as the whole Land. That the Edict of <hi>July</hi> might be recall'd, and only multiplicity of Sects, and ill Language, under the pretence of Liberty, prohibited. That a National Council might be call'd, in which the King ſhould preſide. That all Juriſdictions ſhould be taken from the Church, and annexed to the Crown. There were alſo many other things demanded in this Aſſembly, which tended to the Ruine of the Clergy, the Papal Authority growing into Contempt, and the greateſt part, either out of a deſire to promote Piety,
<note place="margin">The Clergy of <hi>France</hi> give the King Taxes to ſave their Revenues and Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</note> or of Love to Novelty, favouring the Proteſtant Party, and daily increaſing their numbers by joyning with them.</p>
            <p>The Clergy to prevent this Storm wiſely gave the King four Tenths for ſix years, which very much appeaſed the King and the Principal Courtiers towards them.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:51585:30"/>The Queen, by the Advice of <hi>Monluc</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Valence,</hi> wrote about this time a long Letter to the Pope, dated the 5th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 
               <q>In which, ſtating the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers which attended the differences in Religion, ſhe exhorted him to provide ſpeedy Remedies, becauſe they were become ſo numerous,
<note place="margin">☜ ☜</note> that they could no longer be ſuppreſſed by the Sword; that many of the Principal Nobility and Magiſtrates embraced that way, and had drawn over ſuch Numbers, and ſo united them, that they were become formidable to the State; yet by the Rare Bleſſing of Heaven, they had no <hi>Anabaptiſts, Libertines, &amp;c.</hi> none that denied the Apoſtles Creed, or the Interpretation of it received in the Seven General Councils; That therefore moſt were of opinion, that notwithſtanding theſe differences, they ought to be received into the Communion of the Church, which would end in the Peace of the Church; That the uſe of Images, which was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by God, and, as to Adoration, diſproved by St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> ought to be taken away; That Exorciſms and ſome of the Prayers uſed in Baptiſm, might be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; The Lords Supper Adminiſtred to all the Laity in both Kinds, and the Decree of the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> ought not to be preferred before the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God; That the Prayers might be uſed in the Vulgar Tongue, and all that would Communicate might do ſo the firſt <hi>Sunday</hi> of every Month; That the <hi>Pſalms</hi> might be ſung in the <hi>French</hi> Tongue; A Publick Confeſſion of Sins, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for the Prince, the Magiſtrates, Clergy, Good Weather, Fruitful Seaſons, and all Affliction might be in the ſame Tongue; That the late invented Feaſt of the Holy Sacrament might be aboliſhed, it being unneceſſary, and the cauſe of great Scandal and Offence; and that this Myſtery was Inſtituted for a Spiritual Worſhip, and not for Shew and Pomp; That the uſe of the <hi>Latine</hi> Tongue, which was foreign and unknown, was a great fault, the Prayers of the Church belonging not only to the Clergy, but to all; but as now it ſtands, Who can ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to a Prayer in a Language he knows not? That if yet the <hi>Latine</hi> muſt be uſed, it were fit an Interpretation ſhould be made of the Prayers in the Vulgar Tongue; That the Receiving of the Prieſt in the Sacrifice of the Maſs, the People only looking Idely on, is contrary to the Inſtitution; That the <hi>Pſalms</hi> ought to be in the Vulgar Tongue, and alſo the Private Prayers of the People; That theſe things might be granted without derogating from the Papal Authority.</q> The Pope was infinitely offended with this Letter, and the more, becauſe of the fame of a National Council ſhortly to be holden in <hi>France;</hi> but then he diſſembled his Reſentment, and became the more ſincere in the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling a General Council, which he had rather promiſed than deſigned before.</p>
            <p>The Conference was to be begun the Firſt of <hi>Auguſt</hi> at <hi>Poiſſy,</hi>

               </note> and the Biſhops and Divines were already arrived there, and had entered into a Debate, what Points were to be Diſputed; where they ſpent the time to no great purpoſe, diſputing amongſt themſelves concerning the Office of a Biſhop, the Dignity of Cathedral Churches, of Colleges and their Exemptions, of the Ordination of Curates and Prieſts; concerning allowing them Competent Penſions, abating their number, reforming the Diſcipline of the Monaſteries, of Commendam's and Benfices, of cutting off the Pleaſures and Luxuries of the Clergy, and of Cenſures. And they thought the Anſwering ſuch like Queries was of great uſe to the Church in theſe confuſed times. There appeared for the Proteſtants <hi>Auguſtin Marlorat,
<note place="margin">The Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Miniſters.</note> Francis de S. Pol, Jean Remond Merlin, J. Malo, Francis de Mureaux, N. Tobie, Theodore Beza, Claud Briſſon, J. Bouquin, J. Viret, J. de la Tour, Nich. de Crallas,</hi>

Soon after <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> came to <hi>Zurich:</hi> Theſe Asked four things; 1ſt. That the Biſhops ſhould be Parties and not Judges; 2d. That the King and Council ſhould Preſide; 3d. That all things might be determin'd only by the Word of God; 4th. That whatever was agreed, ſhould be ſet down by Notaries. The Queen yielded all theſe, but would have one of the Secretaries of State be the only Notary, and ſhe would not conſent that the King ſhould Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide in the Conference. The Cardinal of <hi>Lorraine</hi> had before objected againſt <hi>Beza,</hi> That he ſhould ſay, that Chriſt was no more preſent in the Sacrament, than in a Muddy Ditch. This Expreſſion is ſaid to have been urged by <hi>Melanchthon</hi> againſt <hi>Oecelampadins</hi> as the Conſequence of his Doctrine, and was by a miſtake of the Cardinal wrongfully charged on <hi>Beza,</hi> who denied and deteſted it as Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous.

<note place="margin">The Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor's Speech.</note> particularly the <hi>Arrian</hi> General Council of <hi>Ariminium</hi> was condemn'd by a Private Council held by St. <hi>Hillary Biſhop of Poictiers,</hi> and baniſhed out of <hi>France.</hi> He ſaid, they neither needed much Learning nor many Books, the <hi>Bible</hi> alone being ſufficient by which Religion was to be Tried and Examined. That the Proteſtants were their Brethren, and to be treated as ſuch; if out of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition or Avarice they did otherwiſe, God would judge and condemn them, and their Decrees would be rejected. That they ought to Amend and give God Thanks for any Errour that was diſcovered, and if they did not, God would Puniſh them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>After him, the Cardinal of <hi>Tournon</hi> ſpoke, and Thanked the King, Queen and Princes for being preſent, and approved highly of what the Chancellor had ſaid, but defired a Copy of it, which the Chancellor refuſed, though it was ſeconded by the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> becauſe he perceived they craftily deſigned to miſchief him by it.

               <hi>Theodore Beza,</hi> being next commanded to ſpeak, fell upon his Knees, and after a Prayer, and reciting his Faith, complained to God, that they had been injuriouſly treated as Enemies of the Publick Peace. Then he ſhewed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they agreed with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and wherein they differed, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed of the way of attaining Salvation, of Faith, Good Works, the Word of God, the Authority of the Councils and Fathers, of the Sacraments, and of their uſe and true Interpretation; of Tranſubſtantiation and Conſubſtantiation, and laſtly, of the Eccleſiaſtical Order and Diſcipline, and obedience to Princes; he was ſo long and ſo ſharp in ſome of theſe things, that they had ſcarce patience to hear him out, and the Cardinal of <hi>Tournon</hi> preſently replied with a Voice trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling for Rage;

               <q>That he and the other Prelates had done violence to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences by condeſcending to this Conference in compliance with his Majeſties Commands, by hearing theſe new Evangeliſts. That he foreſaw, if they were heard, many things would be ſpoken by them injurious to the Majeſty of God, which would offend the Ears of the King, and of all good Men. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he beſeeched his Majeſty not to believe what was ſaid, That if he could have prevented it the King ſhould not have been preſent, but, however, he deſired he would not ſuffer his Mind to be pre-ingaged in their falſe Opinions, but to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend till the Biſhops had Anſwered it, and the King and the reſt there preſent ſhould know the difference between Falſehood and Truth. He Asked a Day to Anſwer in, and prayed the King that he would perſevere in the Religion of his Anceſtors. Laſtly, he added, that, but for the reſpect they bore to the King, the Biſhops would have ariſen and put a ſtop to thoſe horrible and abominable Words.</q>
               <note place="margin">The Queens Anſwer.</note> The Queen calmly ſaid, ſhe had done the thing without the Advice of the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> the Princes, and Privy Council; That no change was deſigned, but that the Diſturbances of <hi>France</hi> might be appeaſed, and Men friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought from their Errors into the Old Way, which belonged to them to effect.</p>
            <p>The firſt Diſpute was,
<note place="margin">The Points debated.</note> about the <hi>Lords Supper;</hi> The ſecond, which was the 17th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> was about the Church, which, the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> ſaid, could not Err, That if any particular Church did, Recourſe was to be had to the Head, the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Decrees of a General Council, and the Concurrent Opinions of the Ancient Fathers; and before all, to the <hi>Sacred Scriptures</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd by the Right Senſe and Interpretation of the Church. As to the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> in effect, he ſaid, That if the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> would not embrace their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, there was no hope of an Agreement. The Cardinal of <hi>Tournon</hi> thereupon applauded his Harangue, and ſaid, he was ready to lay down his Life for this Faith, intreating the King to continue ſtedfaſt in it, and was contented (Good Man!) that if the Proteſtants would ſubſcribe theſe two Points, they ſhould be admitted to diſpute all the reſt; but if they refuſed this, all hearing was to be denied them, and they were to be expell'd out of his Dominions. <hi>Beza</hi> deſired to Anſwer him Extempore, but the King delayed the Anſwer to the next day.</p>
            <p>Upon a Petition, the Miniſters were heard at laſt again the 24th of <hi>September</hi> before the Queen only; when <hi>Beza</hi> diſcourſed of the Church and its Notes, which, he ſaid, were the Preaching of the Word, and a Pure Adminiſtration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments. As for the Succeſſion of Perſons and Doctrines, it had been often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted; He diſcourſed of the Ordinary and Extraordinary Vocation, of the Univerſal Church and her Authority, of Councils, which he affirm'd had, and

The Queen was much enraged at the Inſolence of this Man, but, out of Reverence to the Legate, ſuppreſs'd her reſentment; after this Day there were no more Publick Conferences, but they Drew out three of a Side, and endeavoured to form ſuch an Expoſition of the Lord's Supper as both Parties might agree in, which in the End proved impoſſible to be done, and ſo the Conference of <hi>Poiſſi</hi> ended, which was the firſt Liberty that was granted to diſpute the Eſtabliſhed Religion in <hi>France;</hi> and was blamed by ſome as a thing of ill Example, and approved by others as the only means left to prevent the Storm which hung over their heads.

                  </gap>lved.</hi> 3. <hi>That the Church-men ſhould be reſtored to all they had been depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of.</hi> But the Council replied, That it did not befit them, to treat of things of that Conſequence, before the Aſſembly of the States, which was to be held the 21st of <hi>May,</hi> when the Lord <hi>James</hi> made anſwer, That the <hi>French,</hi> and not the <hi>Scots,</hi> had broke the old League, by endeavouring to enſlave them. 2. That they could not violate the Treaty made with <hi>England;</hi> and, as to the third, That they did not acknowledge thoſe he interceded for, to be <hi>Church men,</hi> and that <hi>Scotland,</hi> having renounced the Pope, would no longer maintain his Prieſts and Vaſſals. About the ſame time, the Earls of <hi>Morton</hi> and <hi>Glencarn</hi> returned from <hi>England,</hi> whither they had been ſent, with Aſſurances, That the Queen <hi>would aſſiſt them in the Defence of the Liberties of the Kingdom, if, at any time, they ſtood in need of her Help;</hi> which was heard with much Joy.</p>
            <p>As the Lord <hi>James</hi> returned into <hi>Scotland,</hi> he waited upon Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and adviſed her to ſtop Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> if ſhe came by <hi>England,</hi> (as he expected ſhe would) 'till he had ſecured the State of Religion in <hi>Scotland;</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>Preteſtant Religion</hi> ſetled in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </note> for tho' ſhe had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, She would continue all things in the State ſhe found them, yet he would not intirely rely upon her Promiſe, having ſo often heard the old Maxim from the late Regent. To make ſure work therefore, he procured an Act to be paſſed in this Convention, for the Demoliſhing all the Cloyſters, and Abby Churches, which were yet left ſtanding in that Kingdom; the Execution whereof, as to the Weſtern Parts, was committed to the Earls of <hi>Arran, Argile,</hi> and <hi>Glencarn;</hi> as to the North, to the Lord <hi>James;</hi> and as to the Inland Counties, to ſome Barons that were thought the moſt Zealous: Whereupon enſued a moſt deplorable Devaſtation of <hi>Churches,</hi> and Church-buildings, ſaith <hi>Spotiſwood,</hi> throughout all the Kingdom; for every one made bold to put to their Hands, the meaner ſort imitating the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the greater, and thoſe who were in Authority. No difference was made, but all the Churches were either defaced, or pulled down to the ground. The Church Plate, and what ever Men could make Money of, as Timber, Lead, and Bells, were put to ſale, and the Monuments of the Dead, the Regiſters of the Churches and Libraries were burn'd or deſtroyed, and what eſcaped the Fury of the firſt Tumults now periſned in a common Shipwrack, and that under the colour of publick Authority. <hi>John Knox</hi> is ſaid to have very much promoted this Calamity, by a Maxim he publiſhed, That the <hi>ſure way to drive away the Rooks, was to pull down their Neſts,</hi> which, in probability, he meant only of the <hi>Monks;</hi> but now their Hands were in, was extended to all the Church Buildings: <hi>Noailles</hi> was then in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and carried the News of this dreadful Reformation to the Queen into <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>She was much enraged at it,
<note place="margin">The Queen angry with the Proceedings.</note> and ſaid to ſome of her Confidents, that ſhe would imitate <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>England;</hi> but however, ſhe had wit enough to diſſemble her Reſentment for the preſent.</p>
            <p>In order to her return,

               </note> ſhe left <hi>Vitri,</hi> and went to <hi>Paris;</hi> and having waited upon the King, and Queen-Regent, to take her leave of them, ſhe took her Journy towards <hi>Calais,</hi> Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had ſent the Earl of <hi>Bedford,</hi> to condole the Death of <hi>Francis,</hi> her late Husband, and to deſire her Ratification of the Treaty of <hi>Leith;</hi> but this, ſhe ſaid, ſhe could not do, 'till ſhe had conſulted with the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of <hi>Scotland;</hi> and when the Ambaſſador replied, They could not but approve of what they had made, ſhe replied, <hi>They did, but not all; and when I come amongſt them, it will appear what mind they are of.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and the reſt of the great Men of that Family, attended her to <hi>Calais,</hi> and the Marqueſs of <hi>Elboeuf,</hi> and <hi>Francis,</hi> Grand <hi>Prior</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> went with her. She took Ship the 14th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and arrived at <hi>Leith</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> the 20th. She was much concerned, for fear Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> might intercept her in her way home, and therefore, ſent again for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ambaſſador; but when he ſtill inſiſted, to have the Treaty of <hi>Leith</hi> ratified, ſhe delayed it. Her Uncle, the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> adviſed her, to leave her Jewels and Treaſures in <hi>France,</hi> 'till ſhe were ſafe in <hi>Scotland;</hi> but ſhe ſaid, It was folly, to be more concerned for her Jewels, than for her Perſon, which ſhe muſt hazard. The truth is, her Fear was well grounded, for Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſent a Fleet to way-lay her; but the two Navies paſſed by one another, in a dark foggy day, unperceived, and ſhe ſafely arrived at <hi>Leith</hi> the 21th of <hi>Auguſt.</hi>

            <p>The beginning of her Government was very gracious, and ſhe condeſcended to grant, <hi>That no Change or Alteration ſhould be made in the preſent State of Religion;</hi>

She kept her Maſſes too, more publickly, and with greater pomp; of all which, the Miniſters complain'd in vain in their Sermons.

            </p>
            <p>The beginning of the Year 1562, was very unquiet in <hi>France.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>French</hi> Affairs.</note> The King had called an Aſſembly of the Delegates of all the Parliaments of <hi>France,</hi> in the end of the laſt year, which was to meet at St. <hi>Germain</hi> the 17th of <hi>January</hi> of this year, to conſider of the means of appeaſing theſe Broils, and preſerving the Peace of <hi>France.</hi> The King opened this Aſſembly with a ſhort Speech, which was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by a larger, made by the Chancellor; who having given a ſhort account of the ſeveral Edicts, that had been made before in the buſineſs of Religion; and ſhewn how they had all, by one means or other, been defeated. He added, That <hi>Laws were of no uſe, if they were not Religiouſly obſerved. But then,</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>if the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:51585:35"/>Queſtion is put, Why are not the Laws executed? Muſt not you, that are the Judges, bear the blame? For if they excuſe themſelves, and ſay, That it was not in their power to execute them, I will accept the Anſwer, upon condition they will ingenuouſly confeſs, That neither was it in the King's power: And that this Affair of Religion, by a ſecret Judgment of God, for the Chaſtiſement of our Luxury, Indevotion, and Neglect of his Glory, is ſo diſpoſed, that we may, by the ſeverity of the Puniſhment, be brought to Repentance. In the year</hi> 1518, <hi>when theſe Commotions firſt began, there is no Man but knows, how corrupt the Manners, and how looſe, or rather profligate, the Diſcipline of the Church was throughout the World: For, to omit the Court of</hi> Rome, <hi>in which, there was nothing right and ſound, we had here in</hi> France <hi>a young King, brought up in Pleaſures, tho' he afterwards was much improved, but he was then very diſſolute; nor was</hi> Henry <hi>of</hi> England <hi>any better: And after all the Judgments God has ſent from Heaven upon us, we have not repented or amended; and therefore, there is no wonder, that this ſad difference of Religion cannot be compoſed, and the Peace of the Church reſtored. No, on the contrary it is now apparent, that our Enemies are become ſo numerous, that they are almoſt able to oppreſs us. As to thoſe who pretend, that we have encreaſed them by our Connivance, I can anſwer, That during the minority of the King, they are bolder, and I would have them conſider too, that, for our Sins, God has ſet a Child over us. There are ſome, who would have the King arm one part of his Subjects againſt the other, which, I think, is neither Chriſtian, nor Human.</hi> After very much to the ſame purpoſe, he told them, the Thing propoſed by the King to their Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was, <hi>Whether it was the beſt way for the King to Suppreſs the Meetings, or to Tolerate them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thereupon followed a very great Debate between theſe Deputies of the ſeveral Parliaments of <hi>France,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A Debate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</note> but, at laſt, they came to a Reſolution, to remit ſomething of the Severity of the <hi>Edict</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> and to allow the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> the liberty of Publick Sermons;
<note place="margin">The Edict of <hi>January,</hi> which granted Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Proteſtants.</note> and accordingly a new Edict was made, which was called, <hi>The Edict of January,</hi> the principal Heads of which, were theſe: <q>That the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſhould reſtore the Eccleſiaſticks to their Churches, Houſes, Lands, Tithes, and other goods whatſoever which they had taken from them forthwith, and ſuffer them peaceably to enjoy their Images, Croſſes, and Statues, without any moleſtation, or endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to deſtroy them; or doing any other thing that may diſturb the publick Peace, upon pain of Death, without any hope of Mercy. That the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſhould have no publick Meetings, Sermons, and Prayers; or adminiſter any Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, publickly or privately, by Night or by Day, within any City, in any manner whatſoever: <hi>Yet,</hi> in the mean time, till the Controverſies of Religion ſhall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by a General Council, or the King ſhall otherwiſe order it, Thoſe, who ſhall go to, or frequent, their Sermons ſhall not be moleſted, provided they be had without the Cities. And the Magiſtrates were accordingly commanded, not to diſquiet, but to protect and preſerve them from all Injury. That all Seditious Perſons, of what Religion ſoever they were, ſhould be ſeverely puniſhed, and all ſhould be bound to diſcover and deliver them up to Juſtice, a thouſand Crowns being impoſed upon any perſon who ſhould receive, abet, or conceal, ſuch Rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Offender, and the Offender to be whipp'd, if not able to pay the Penalty. That the ſaid Meetings ſhould be without Arms, and that no perſon ſhould Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach another on the account of Religion, or uſe any Factious Names. That the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Miniſters ſhould admit none into their Number, till they had diligently examined their Lives, Converſations, and Doctrines. That the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates might freely go to their Meetings, to ſee what was done, or to apprehend any Criminal, who ſhould be treated according to their Dignity, and obeyed. That the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſhould hold no Synods, Conferences, or Conſiſtories, but in the preſence of a Magiſtrate. That they ſhould create no new Magiſtrates, or make any Laws or Statutes: And if they deſire any thing by way of Diſcipline, it ſhould be referred to their Authority, or, if need be, be confirmed by them. There ſhall be no Levies of Men or Monies made by them, nor any Leagues entered into for their private Defence. And as to Alms, they ſhall only take them of ſuch as are willing to give. The Civil Laws, eſpecially thoſe concerning Holy Days, and the Degrees of Conſanguinity and Affinity in Marriages, ſhall be obſerved. That their Paſtors ſhall give Security to the Magiſtrates, for the Obſerving this Edict, and promiſe, That they will not preach any Doctrine contrary to the <hi>Nicene</hi> or <hi>Apoſtles Creeds,</hi> or the Books of the <hi>Old</hi> or <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> nor uſe any Reproaches againſt the <hi>Catholicks</hi> in their Sermons: And the ſame is injoyned the <hi>Catholicks,</hi> in relation to the <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> No man ſhall publiſh any Libels to defame another, or ſell, or cauſe them to be ſold. Laſtly, the Magiſtrates are hereby commanded to be

<note place="margin">Injunctions publiſhed by the Queen's Order, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</note> theſe Propoſitions were publiſhed by the Queen, by the Advice of the Biſhops of <hi>Valence</hi> and <hi>Seez,</hi> and Monſieur <hi>Bouthillier, d' Eſpence,</hi> and <hi>Picherel.</hi> 
               <q>That ſeeing Errors are, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> rather to be rooted out of the Minds of Men, than out of Churches, and other places, the Biſhops ſhould take order with the Curates, to have the People well Inſtructed, and diligently Admoniſhed, concerning the right uſe of them, that all Offence or Scandal might be prevented, both by the Royal Authority, and that of the Church; and that if any oppoſed this, he ſhould be treated as a Violater of the Royal Edicts, and of the publick Peace.
<note place="margin">Images of the Trinity forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</note> That all Figures of the <hi>Holy Trinity</hi> ſhould be immediately removed out of all Churches, and all other publick and private Places, as being forbidden by the Holy Scriptures, the Councils and Teſtimonies of the Fathers, and only Diſſembled or Tolerated by the Sloth of the Biſhops and Paſtors.

            <p>

<note place="margin">The King of <hi>Navar</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends ſtill to promote the Reformation.</note> the King of <hi>Navar</hi> wrote a Letter to the <hi>Elector Palatine,</hi> in which, he teſtified his great deſire to promote a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that he hoped to have found a way to reconcile Differences, by the Conference of <hi>Poiſſi.</hi> But that this Affair had not ſucceeded according to his wiſh; and that, even in the Diſpute about Images, which ſeemed to have leſs of Difficulty, they had yet not been able to agree. But that, whatever Men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, he would, by the help of God, endeavour, that the Confeſſion of Faith, which could not be deſtroyed, without the Ruin of the Peace of the Nation, ſhould inſenſibly be eſtabliſhed as far as the Infancy of the King, and the preſent State of Things would permit.</q> He wrote alſo, to the ſame purpoſe, to the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> and to <hi>Philip Landtgrave</hi> of <hi>Heſſe.</hi> The <hi>Elector Palatine</hi> wrote an Anſwer, dated the 20th of <hi>April,</hi> from <hi>Heidelburg,</hi> wherein he ſaid, he was ſorry to ſee the Affections of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> cool in this Affair; and therefore, he exhorted him to go on in this commendable Deſign of Reforming Religion.</p>
            <p>When the Edict of <hi>January</hi> came to be publiſhed, the <hi>Guiſes</hi> and <hi>Montmorancy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Edict of <hi>January</hi> oppoſed by the <hi>Guiſes</hi> and others.</note> who were now reconciled, and were abſent at the time of making it, employed all their Induſtry, to prevent its having its effect; alledging, it was not made as it ought, and would prove deſtructive to the Kingdome of <hi>France;</hi> and having brought over <hi>Navar</hi> to their Party, tho' they foreſaw they ſhould meet with great, and almoſt inſuperable, Difficulties; yet, they thought, they ſhould at laſt gain their Ends. The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> went therefore to his Country Houſe, and his Brother <hi>Charles,</hi> the Cardinal, ſoon after followed him thither: So they both went to <hi>Zaberen,</hi> a Town belonging to the Biſhop of <hi>Strasburg,</hi> where <hi>Chriſtopher,</hi> Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> met him, on pretence he came to viſit a Lady that was his Kinſwoman, bringing with him <hi>John Brent,</hi> and <hi>James Andrea,</hi> two eager defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the <hi>Auguſtane</hi> Confeſſion againſt the <hi>Zuinglians,</hi> (whoſe Doctrine was generally followed by the Proteſtants in <hi>France;</hi>) here they conferred together three days. The Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> pretended to have a great affection for the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>German</hi> Princes; he ſaid alſo, That ſince the Conference of <hi>Poiſſi,</hi> he had a good opinion of the <hi>Auguſtane Confeſſion,</hi> and that he had often perſuaded the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to ſubſcribe it, and they had ever refuſed
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:51585:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>it, becauſe they did not ſo much deſire the Reformation of Religion, and of the Church Diſcipline, as the ſpreading lewd and monſtrous Opinions, which tended to the filling <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> with new Tumults. That the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> wiſely foreſaw this, who congratulating, by his Ambaſſador, the attempt, to reform the Church, expreſſed at the ſame time his fear, that they ſhould embrace the <hi>Zuinglian</hi> and <hi>Geneva</hi> Confeſſion, inſtead of the <hi>Auguſtane;</hi> and thereupon carefully adviſed the King of <hi>Navar,</hi> to conſider this. That the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> and the other Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> ought to fear the ſame thing, if they deſired the Peace of <hi>Germany,</hi> or that of the Church: For that as <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>France</hi> were near each other, ſo their Intereſts were ſo interwoven, that the Good or Evil would be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to them. That as they were derived from one of the Illuſtrious Families of <hi>Germany,</hi> and enjoyed one of the principal Stations in <hi>France;</hi> ſo they had left that Kingdom to confer with him (the Duke of <hi>Wirtemburg),</hi> and to ſettle, by mutual Conſent, what might be uſeful and ſalutary to both theſe States, and that they might conjointly oppoſe the Endeavours of the <hi>Zuinglians,</hi> and their Doctrine. They pretended, they did not do this, with intention to hinder the Reformation of Religion, and the Worſhip of God, <hi>For that they deſired above all things;</hi> but that they ſought to prevent that Tempeſt, which theſe Sectaries were raiſing, both in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany:</hi> And therefore, they deſired the Duke, to interpoſe his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority with the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> and to induce them to have a good Opinion of their Deſigns.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Wirtemburg</hi> (having conſulted with <hi>Brent</hi> and <hi>Andrea,</hi> his two Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, who were very deſirous, the <hi>Helvetian Confeſſion</hi> ſhould not be entertained in <hi>France</hi>) commended the Cardinals affections towards himſelf and the Empire; and ſaid, he approved of his Counſel, for the hindering the Reception of that Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in <hi>France,</hi> which, without doubt, would cauſe great Commotions. But then, he ſaid, this was upon condition, that the Reformation ſhould be carried on in <hi>France</hi> in the mean time; and that no Severities or Proſcriptions ſhould be employed againſt thoſe, who had made defection from the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Cardinal was thought to have ſaid this, to the intent, to diſpoſe the <hi>German</hi> Proteſtant Princes to ſend Supplies againſt the <hi>French Proteſtants,</hi> when it ſhould come to a War; or, at leaſt, to make them leſs apt to ſuccour the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> and the Proteſtants.

In the Borders of <hi>Champaigne,</hi> there is a Town, called <hi>Vaſſy,</hi> which has high Walls, and is the Capital of a Prefecture: The Proteſtants had a Meeting-place in this Town, able to contain twelve Hundred perſons, in which, at times, they preached, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred Sacraments after their way, becauſe they had, as yet, no ſetled Miniſter, but procured one from <hi>Troyes;</hi> (The Biſhop of which place was a favourer of them.)

The year before, the Biſhop came thither, and had a diſorderly Diſpute with the Miniſter, about impoſition of Hands, managed by one of his Divines, which he brought with him before the People, Governour and Biſhop, which had no good effect. <hi>Antonia de Bourbon,</hi> the Mother of the <hi>Guiſes,</hi> a zealous <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> was alſo much offended with the nearneſs of this place, and deſired very much to be rid of it; and ſhe reproached her Son, for his over-great patience in a thing, wherein the Glory of God, her own Honour, and the Religion of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, was concerned. Hereupon, the firſt of <hi>March,</hi> he went to <hi>Vaſſy,</hi> with <hi>Lewis</hi> the Cardinal his Brother, <hi>Du Broſſay,</hi> and his Son, and a great Retinue, deſigning rather to ſuppreſs and diſſipate this Conventicle by his Preſence, than to offer Violence to any private perſon. As he went, he heard a Bell ring at an unuſual time, and asking the reaſon of it, was told, It was to call the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to their Meeting. Hereupon, his Foot-men began to make a Noiſe, as if there had been a Military Enterprize; but the Duke went on, and entred <hi>Vaſſy,</hi> where there were 60 Horſe ready to receive him, and he was to dine that day at <hi>Sclaron.</hi> The <hi>Curate</hi> and <hi>Prior</hi> were very earneſt with him, to go by the Conventicle; but whilſt he delayed them, and ſeemed unwilling to do it, the meaner part of his Attendants ran thither, and began to call the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> who were there aſſembled,

A great Cry ariſing, <hi>Guiſe</hi> was forced to go thither, to put a ſtop to the Maſſacre, but he by Accident receiving a ſmall Wound, this ſo inraged his Retinue, that he could not reſtrain them; in this Tumult about 60 perſons were kill'd, and 200 wounded, amongſt which laſt was <hi>Morell,</hi> who was ſent Priſoner to <hi>Diſier.</hi>

Here ſhe would have made her Eſcape with the King, if the Jealouſie of the Confederates had not prevented it; They knowing this would give a great Reputation to the Party that could gain it, and make the oppoſite Party look like Rebels. Next Morning the Queen fell to flatter the Confederates to get them to go back to <hi>Fontainbleau,</hi> and that ſhe might ſpeak with <hi>Conde.</hi> But the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> diſappointed all her Projects, and carried the King and his Brother to the Caſtle <hi>de Vincennes,</hi> within two Miles of <hi>Paris,</hi> the <hi>King weeping, as if he had been carried into Captivity by force.</hi>

He leaving the City thereupon, they took St. <hi>Catherine</hi>'s, a Monaſtery without the City, and put a Gariſon into it.

That all ſhould lay down their Arms, upon what pretence ſoever they had been Liſted, or by whom ſoever. And they that had no Commiſſion from the King, ſhould be treated as Traitors. That the King of <hi>Navar</hi> only ſhould have the Right of Levying Men, till theſe Troubles were ended by a Treaty or a Victory, and they to be paid out of the Treaſury.

The Country in the mean time was expoſed to Rapine, under pretence of Extirpating Hereticks, the great Men conniving at it, or being well pleaſed: And a War was Proclaimed againſt the Proteſtants, and all Men were commanded to treat them as the Enemies of Mankind, on the account of the Sacriledges committed in the Churches, becauſe the Church Plate was taken to be Minted for Money to pay the Army, and the Images and Altars were generally beaten down where the Proteſtants prevail'd. Whereupon the Peaſants left their Work, and fell to Rob and Plunder their Neighbours, and to exerciſe unheard of Cruelties and Barbarities, they thinking the Proteſtants were to be treated like Mad Dogs. This forced the Gentry in a ſhort time to Arm againſt them, and they treated the Monks and Prieſts in their own Kind, and Hang'd up thoſe <hi>Catholick Peaſants.</hi>

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:51585:42"/>which now, to their great damage, they perſuaded the Townſmen to defend, it being ſoon taken, and all that Plate melted down, and the Inhabitants very ſeverely uſed for their Reſiſtance, and ſeveral of them hanged, the Prieſts eſcaping in the Tumult. In <hi>Beauſſe,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> took <hi>Eſtampes,</hi> after which, he beſieged <hi>Pluviers</hi> with 800 Horſe, who took the Suburbs; the Gariſon of which, ſallying out, retired to <hi>Orleans,</hi> leaving their Carriages behind them. Whilſt the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> was buſie in preparing Neceſſaries for the Siege of this great City, <hi>Andelot,</hi> who had undertaken the Defence of it, was as intent in fortifying and ſtoring the City with all things that were neceſſary. There were in it 14 Companies of <hi>Germans,</hi> and 4 of Townſmen, and many of the Nobility, all well Armed.</p>
            <p>The Queen,
<note place="margin">The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> carried to <hi>Blois.</hi>
               </note> when ſhe had ſtayed a while at <hi>Chartres,</hi> went with the King to <hi>Blois,</hi> (as is ſaid) carrying with them the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> under a ſtrong Guard; from whence, ſhe ſent him to the Caſtle of <hi>Onzain,</hi> a ſtrong place in <hi>Angoumoiſe. Coligni</hi> was, in the mean time, wholly intent on the appeaſing of the <hi>Germans,</hi> fearing they would mutiny for their Pay, which, he ſaid, would be ſent in a ſhort time from <hi>England;</hi> ſo that, at laſt, he obliged them to promiſe, they would not deſert him. The Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> having quitted <hi>Beauſſe,</hi> was by this time come to <hi>Baugy,</hi> where there were ſome Skirmiſhes of no great conſequence between him and the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants. Some mention was made alſo of a Peace, the Princeſs of <hi>Conde</hi> propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, That her Husband, and <hi>Montmorancy,</hi> ſhould be ſet at liberty to that end, but there was nothing done in it. The Sieur <hi>Boucart,</hi> a Commander under <hi>Coligni,</hi> was coming before, <hi>Trimoville,</hi> a Town upon the <hi>Loire,</hi> which was under one <hi>Potin,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it to ſurrender; which being refuſed, he took it by force, and put the Inhabitants to the Sword; amongſt whom, were 36 Prieſts: From whence, he went to <hi>Gien,</hi> which was preſerved out of his hands by three Companies of <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who were ſent thither for the approaching Siege of <hi>Orleans. Coligni,</hi> in the mean time, left <hi>Gergeau,</hi> and went to <hi>Orleans,</hi> to conſult with the other Commanders what was beſt to be done, and there it was reſolved, the <hi>Germans</hi> ſhould be ſent into <hi>Normandy,</hi> to be ready to receive their Pay out of <hi>England,</hi> which their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders readily accepted; <hi>Coligni</hi> went with them, and <hi>Gramont</hi> undertook the defence of <hi>Orleans, Andelot</hi> being ſick. <hi>Coligni</hi> was all the way plied with Meſſages from the Queen, for a Peace, to hinder his Journey: The firſt of <hi>February,</hi> he arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with 4000 Horſe at <hi>Trcon,</hi> and took a view of the place, in which the late Battel was fought, from thence he went to <hi>Eureux:</hi> He took ſoon after St. <hi>Pere de Melun,</hi> a rich Monaſtery, and finding great Riches in its Church, which had been given by the Sea-men, he took its Wealth, and, which was worſe reſented, deſtroyed thoſe Images which were moſt addreſſed to in Diſtreſſes. Soon after, eight <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships came to <hi>Havre de Grace,</hi> in which, were five <hi>Engliſh</hi> Companies, eight Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, great quantities of Ammunition and Money; whereupon he reſolved to take the Caſtle of <hi>Caen,</hi> before he went back to <hi>Orleans,</hi> and, the firſt of <hi>March,</hi> raiſed a Battery of four Cannon againſt it, and took it in a few days, tho' the Duke of <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boeuf</hi> was Commander of it, who muſt have been taken too, but that <hi>Coligni</hi> was in haſt to relieve <hi>Orleans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> began the Siege of <hi>Orleans</hi> the 7th of <hi>February,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Siege of <hi>Orleans.</hi>
               </note> and attack'd the Suburb de <hi>Olivet,</hi> which <hi>Andelot</hi> had ordered to be deſerted; but, by the negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the <hi>Germans,</hi> had like the next day to have proved the loſs of the City, <hi>Guiſe</hi> his Forces getting into it, before the <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>French</hi> could withdraw, and fire the Houſes; many of them periſhed in the Crowd, at the paſſage of the Bridge which led to the City, and was then imbaraſſed with the Goods the <hi>Germans</hi> had heaped up there: But <hi>Andelot</hi> making a ſharp Sally at the Head of a Troop of Gentlemen, opened the way, and kept off the Enemy; it's ſaid however, 800 of the Beſieged periſhed in this Tumult; others ſay, not half the number: But yet, however, it was a great loſs, and much incommoded the City. Two days after, the other Suburbs were taken. The 18th of <hi>February,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> wrote to the Queen, That the Siege was very forward, and that, in a few days, he ſhould ſend her the joyful News it was taken; but the ſame day, towards night, as he was riding with ſome Officers,
<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by one <hi>Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trot.</hi>
               </note> he was ſhot in the Side by one <hi>John Poltrot,</hi> near his Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit. This perſon was a Gentleman of <hi>Engouleſme,</hi> and brought up as Page in the Family of <hi>Francis Boucart</hi> Baron <hi>d' Aubeterre,</hi> and having in his Childhood lived in <hi>Spain,</hi> could imitate that Nation to a wonder, and was commonly called, <hi>The Little Spaniard,</hi> he had long ſince reſolved to be the death of this great Man, and had foretold it publickly, and was ſo much the leſs ſuſpected, becauſe he was thought a cloſe diſſembling Fellow. Being ſent by his Maſter to learn an Account
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:51585:42"/>of the Battel of <hi>Dreux,</hi> he found <hi>Coligni</hi> at the Siege of <hi>Ceel,</hi> who gave him Money to buy a fleet Horſe; after which he never returned to his Lord, and this made <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligni</hi> ſuſpected, as conſcious of the Deſign. From thence he went to the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> his Quarters, and contracted an Acquaintance with his Servants, and this day after a Prayer to God to direct him, lying in wait, Shot him as he was returning home in the Evening. <hi>Poltrot</hi> fled into the next Wood, and they who purſued him could not find him; and when he had rode all night, and quite tired his Horſe, next morning he came to <hi>Pont Olivet</hi> by <hi>Orleans;</hi> which being unknown to him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thought by him to be very diſtant from the place he fled from, he laid him down to ſleep, and was taken upon ſuſpicion by the Searchers, and being known, was brought to the Queen to St. <hi>Ilario,</hi> and Examined concerning the Fact, and by whoſe Procurement he did it. He ſaid, he had been twice ſolicited to it by <hi>Coligni,</hi> and had at laſt conſented to it upon the perſwaſion of <hi>Beza</hi> and another Miniſter, but he ſaid, the Prince of <hi>Conde, Andelot,</hi> and the <hi>Sieur de Soubieze</hi> knew nothing of it. He adviſed the Queen to have a care of her ſelf too, becauſe the Proteſtants were ill affected to her ſince the Battel of <hi>Dreux,</hi> and that <hi>Monpenſier</hi> and <hi>Sanſac</hi> were alſo deſigned to be cut off: An Account of which Confeſſion being ſent to <hi>Cologni</hi> by a <hi>German</hi> Priſoner, the 12th of <hi>March</hi> he publiſhed a Paper in his own defence, in which he call'd God and Man to Witneſs, that he never ſaw nor knew <hi>Poltrot</hi> before the laſt <hi>January,</hi> and he had given him Money and employed him as a <hi>Spie</hi> in the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> his Camp, That when he went into <hi>Normandy,</hi> he had given him 100 Crowns to acquaint <hi>Andelot</hi> with what paſſed there; and that all he had ſaid beſides were lies and falſehoods; That though he was not much concern'd for the death of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> who was an Enemy to the King, and to the Reformation, and all that Embraced it, yet he ever deteſted theſe ways of Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and had never by himſelf or any other asked any ſuch thing of <hi>Poltrot,</hi> though he had before this diſcovered, and could prove ſuch deſigns were entred into againſt <hi>Conde, Andelot,</hi> and himſelf, before the Queen and <hi>Montmorancy,</hi> to whom he had produced good Aſſurances of it. <hi>Beza</hi> alſo in the ſame Paper, ſaid, he never ſaw <hi>Poltrot</hi> in all his Life; and <hi>Rochefocault</hi> ſaid the ſame. <hi>Coligni</hi> ſent the ſame day a Letter to the Queen to intreat her to keep <hi>Poltrot,</hi> that the truth of his innocence might be made out from him, before he were Executed.
<note place="margin">The Death and Character of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe.</hi>
               </note> The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> in the mean time died the 24th of <hi>February,</hi> having purged himſelf of the Maſſacre of <hi>Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay,</hi> and Adviſed the Queen to make a Peace as ſoon as was poſſible. He was a Great Man in the Opinion of his Enemies, a good Soldier, and both fortunate and prudent in his Actions, but falling into a divided Factious State, he was by his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Charles,</hi> a violent Man, miſled, though he often deteſted his Adviſes. Though he had no Command in the Battel of <hi>Dreux,</hi> yet he alone procured the Victory, this made him the ſole General, and being terrible to the Proteſtants, it haſtened his Ruine, but then it had ill Conſequences (though at firſt it occaſioned a ſpeedy Peace) in after times. The Children of the Duke growing up in the Civil Wars which followed, inherited the popularity of their Father, and under the Pretences of Religion, and the Sloath of the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> endeavoured firſt to Revenge their Fathers Death on the Proteſtants, and at laſt turned their Arms againſt the Royal Family, to the great hazard of its Ruine and their own too.</p>
            <p>Soon after the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> was wounded, the Queen ſent <hi>Henry de Cloet,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Queen earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires a Peace.</note> and the Biſhop of <hi>Limoges,</hi> to the Princeſs of <hi>Conde</hi> and <hi>Andelot,</hi> to treat of a Peace ſeveral times. And when he was dead, ſhe yet more earneſtly deſired it, fearing <hi>Conde</hi> and <hi>Montmorancy,</hi> the Heads of the two Parties. Or, as <hi>Davila</hi> ſaith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſirous to drive out the Foreign Forces before they could ſettle themſelves, and above all, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> out of <hi>Havre de Grace.</hi> Beſides ſhe wanted a General to Head the Kings Forces, <hi>Montmorency</hi> being then a Priſoner, and none of the reſt being equal to the Prince of <hi>Conde, Coligni,</hi> or <hi>Andelot;</hi> beſides, the Royal Revenues were by the War reduced to ſo low an Ebb, that they were forced to borrow of their Neighbours to ſupport the War. In the mean time <hi>Francis de Briqueville Baron de Columbiers</hi> was employed by <hi>Coligni</hi> to take <hi>Bayeux,</hi> before which he came the 12th of <hi>February,</hi> and though at firſt repulſed, yet upon the bringing four Cannon from <hi>Caen,</hi> he took the City the Fourth of <hi>March,</hi> the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon helping him to plunder it, and many of the Inhabitants, eſpecially of the Clergy, were ſlain, becauſe they were thought to have occaſion'd the reſiſtance which was made. Soon after St. <hi>Lo</hi> was deſerted, and fell into the hands of the Proteſtants, and after it <hi>Auranches. Vire</hi> had expell'd the Proteſtants, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to defend it ſelf, but was taken by Storm towards Night, which increaſed the Calamities of the Inhabitants. <hi>Honfleur</hi> was taken by <hi>De Mouy,</hi> the Fourteenth
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:51585:43"/>of <hi>March.</hi> About this time <hi>Coligni</hi> having made <hi>Montgomery</hi> Governor of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi> went from <hi>Caen</hi> with a gallant Army towards <hi>Liſieux,</hi> where he was excluded by the Gariſon, and from thence to <hi>Bernay,</hi> which preſuming to do ſo too, he took the Town and made a great ſlaughter of the Inhabitants, deſtroying all their Images and Altars, and handling their Prieſts very ſeverely. The 7th of <hi>March</hi> the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> and <hi>Montmorancy</hi> were brought to the Iſland <hi>Boaria</hi> near <hi>Orleans</hi> under ſtrong Guards,
<note place="margin">The Treaty of Peace between the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> and <hi>Montmorancy.</hi>
               </note> and a Treaty of Peace was opened: And <hi>Montmorancy</hi> declaring he would never conſent to the Edict of <hi>January,</hi> other Conditions were propoſed, to the great diſſatisfaction of the Proteſtants. <hi>Conde,</hi> upon his promiſe, had leave given him to enter <hi>Orleans,</hi> where he treated with the Proteſtant Miniſters, but finding them reſolved to ſtand to the Edict of <hi>January,</hi> the 12th of <hi>March</hi> he came to an Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the Queen, which was ſubſcribed by the King the 19th of the ſame Month. The Terms of which were,
<note place="margin">The Articles agreed on.</note> That, 1. All the Nobility ſhould permit what Religion they pleaſed, who had Sovereign Authority, in their Juriſdictions. That all Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſhould have the free Exerciſe of Religion in their Families, if they did not live in Corporate Towns. That in every Generalite or Prefecture one City ſhould be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for thoſe of the Religion. And, that wherever they had at this day a Liberty, they ſhould ſtill enjoy it. All Offences were remitted, and the Royal Moneys ſpent in the War; and <hi>Conde</hi> was acknowledged the Kings faithful and Loyal Kinſman; and the Nobility, Captains, and all others who had aſſiſted him, were pronounced to have done all things for the Kings Service, and with a good Intention.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Coligni</hi> was kept in <hi>Normandy</hi> by the Flattering Proſperity of his Arms,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Coligni</hi> not pleaſed with the Peace.</note> and though he was, by many Letters from the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> preſſed to haſten his Journey to <hi>Orleans,</hi> yet he did not arrive there before the 23 of <hi>March.</hi> The next day he could not diſſemble his diſcontent at the Terms of the Treaty of Peace, telling the Prince publickly, <hi>That he wondered, how they could be prevailed upon to clap up a Peace upon ſuch diſadvantageous Conditions, when the Affairs of the Proteſtants were in ſo flouriſhing a ſtate. That they ought to have remembred, that in the beginning of the War, the</hi> Triumvirate <hi>had conſented, that the Edict of</hi> January <hi>ſhould be reſtored, and that now two of them</hi> (the King of <hi>Navar</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi>) <hi>were ſlain, and</hi> Montmorancy <hi>was their Priſoner, and conſequently a Security for the Prince of</hi> Conde; <hi>Why ſhould not they have had the ſame Terms? That the reſtraint of the Profeſſion of the Proteſtant Religion to one place in a Province, was to give up that by a daſh of the Pen, which their Sword could never have obtained. That what was granted to the Nobility could not be denied; and they would ſoon ſee it was ſafer to ſerve God in the Suburbs of great Cities, than in their Private Families; and that it was uncertain whether their Children would be at all like them.</hi> But however nothing could reſcind an Agreement made by common conſent. Thus ended the firſt Civil War of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have tranſcribed this whole Account of the firſt Civil War of <hi>France</hi> from the great <hi>Thuanus,</hi> abridging it as much as was poſſible, and purſuing the Actions only of the great Armies; becauſe if I had taken in all he relates of the various Actions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Parties in the ſeveral great Cities and Provinces, it would have ſwell'd infinitely beyond the deſign of this Work, or otherwiſe have been ſo dark as not to be eaſily intelligible. And if the Reader compare this ſhort Account with that given by <hi>Davila,</hi> he will ſoon ſee, how little the ſincerity of that Hiſtorian is to be relied on, and how ſmall the Reaſon is, for him to treat the <hi>Huguenots</hi> as Rebels in all the Courſe of this War.</p>
            <p>When the War firſt began, the Proteſtants acted purely on the defenſive, but after ſeveral local Maſſacres, they began to pull down Images and Altars in Revenge, for the blood-ſhed of the other Party, and finding, to their coſt, this did but enrage the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks againſt them, and made them the more cruel, they fell next upon the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Monks,</hi> as the Authors of their Calamities, this more incenſing the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks; And they again uſing the moſt horrid barbarities that were ever practiſed by Men, the Proteſtants roſe likewiſe in their Executions on them; ſo that if this War had continued a few years, <hi>France</hi> muſt have been depopulated. Now though in all this the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks were the firſt Agreſſors, and forced the Proteſtants to this ſeverity in their own defence, yet their Writers cunningly omitting the Provocation, or ſofting the Actions of their own Party, ſet forth at large the Cruelties of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, (as they call them) and many times aggravate them above what is true; but <hi>Thuanus,</hi> though a <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick, was too great a Man to be guilty of ſo falſe a repreſentation, and who ever pleaſeth to conſult him, will find, I have been very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks in this Abſtract, and have not ſought occaſions to make them odious without cauſe.</p>

<note place="margin">The Cardinal of <hi>Ferrara</hi> leaves <hi>France.</hi>
               </note> the Cardinal of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> the Pope's Legate in <hi>France</hi> after the Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Edict of <hi>January,</hi> ſeeing all things there in the ſtate he deſired, he took his leave of the King and returned into <hi>Italy.</hi> Before he went, however, he took care to furniſh the King with Money to carry on the Siege of <hi>Orleans,</hi> which he took up of the Bankers of <hi>Paris.</hi> He had raiſed a vaſt Expectation of this Council in the minds of all thoſe who had yet any Kindneſs left in their Hearts for the <hi>See of Rome;</hi> and the more, becauſe they thought the Edict of <hi>January</hi> which had cauſed the War, would then fall of Courſe, it being made only by way of Proviſion till a Council ſhould determine otherwiſe. As the Cardinal was in his Journey Fifty Horſemen came out of <hi>Orleans</hi> under the Command of one <hi>Monſieur Dampier,</hi> and ſurprized all his Mules, Horſes, and Treaſures, and when he ſent a Trumpeter to demand them again, the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> made Anſwer, That this magnificent and warlike Equipage did not befit Paſtors and the Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> but rather Commanders and Generals of War who were in Arms for Religion.

<note place="margin">The Cauſes of the Delay of the Council.</note> the Pope putting it off, becauſe he was as much afraid of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Biſhops as of the <hi>French National Council.</hi> He had been ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to grant great Contributions to King <hi>Philip</hi> to be levied upon his Clergy, and he thought the Biſhops would on that ſcore come with exaſperated Minds to the Council; and all his Thoughts were bent on the keeping the Papal Power undiminiſhed, rather than on ſatisfying the juſt Compaints of the Nations.

On the contrary, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed they would only continue the former Council; and therefore they uſed a middle way, and decreed, <hi>A Council ſhould be Celebrated.</hi> The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Biſhops were as much diſſatisfied becauſe all the Power of propoſing was given to the <hi>Legates,</hi> and taken from the other Biſhops, and complained of it to King <hi>Philip;</hi> who Ordered his <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> to treat the Pope about it, that the Council might be free. The Pope Anſwered the Ambaſſador, <hi>That he was not at leiſure to diſpute about Ablative Caſes Poſitive, and the Genders of Words, and that he had ſomething elſe to do.</hi> And in private he ſpoke of the Calamities and Dangers of <hi>France</hi> with the ſame unconcernedneſs. For when one of the <hi>French</hi> Cardinals deplored the Danger the See of <hi>Rome</hi> was in of loſing that Kingdom, he replied, <hi>What then? if as long as I am Biſhop of this City I ſhall not be forced to abate any thing of the Greatneſs of my Table, and the Magnificence of my Buildings.</hi> And when they inſiſted to have the Manners of Men and the Diſcipline of the Church throughly Reform'd, he ſaid, <hi>In that Particular he would ſatisfie</hi> France <hi>to the full, and take ſuch Care in it, that they ſhould all of them Repent that they had mentioned a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Adding, <hi>That he foreſaw that the Kingdom would be divided on the account of Religion, but he did not value the loſs of it a Farthing.</hi> All which Expreſſions ſaith <hi>Thuanus, Are in the Letters of the French Ambaſſador that was then at</hi> Rome, <hi>out of which I have faithfully Tranſcribed them; and the Letters are now in my Hands.</hi> The Hiſtory of this Council is ſo well deſcribed by <hi>Petro Soave Polano,</hi> a Venetian, which is in Engliſh, that I need the leſs inſiſt upon it; but I ſhall however remark ſome few things from <hi>Thuanus</hi> and others, for the Enlarging or Confirming the Credit of that Hiſtory, which is much cryed down by the Roman Catholicks; as certainly they have good Reaſon to be offended with that Author, who with ſo much Truth and Impartiality has diſcovered the Artifices of that Aſſembly, for the keeping up the Grandeur of the <hi>Court of Rome,</hi> and the Suppreſſion and Baffling that Reformation, which the moſt Learned of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> then ſo much deſired and panted after.</p>
            <p>The Second Seſſion was held the Twenty ſixth of <hi>February,</hi>

For the Books were Prohibited and Condemned, in which the Authority of Princes and Temporal Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates is defended from the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpations of the Clergy; and of Councils and Biſhops from the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpations of the Court of</hi> Rome, <hi>in which their Hypocriſies or Tyrannies are manifeſted, by which the People, under pretence of Religion are deceived. In ſumm, a better Myſtery was never found out than to uſe Religion to make Men inſenſible.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever this may help to keep thoſe in their Church which they now have; it doth certainly by Experience render them very Contemptible to all others, and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:51585:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>unable to defend their Religion; which is eſpecially true of their Laity.</p>
            <p>The Fourth of <hi>March</hi> the buſineſs of the Safe Conduct was diſpatched in a Congregation;
<note place="margin">A debate whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence are of Divine Right.</note> and a Debate was raiſed and purſued with great Heat by the Spaniſh Biſhops, <hi>That Epiſcopacy was inſtituted by God without any Medium; and that Reſidence and their Pastoral Deligence, in feeding their Flock, was of</hi> Divine Right, <hi>which they deſired might be Confirmed by the Decree of the Council.</hi> But becauſe this tended to the Eſtabliſhing the Authority of the Biſhops, and the Abating that of the Pope, his Holineſs was much concern'd at it, and having conſulted the Cardinals about it, they by common conſent Delayed, and by ambiguous Anſwers deluded the Fathers at <hi>Trent,</hi> and at laſt totally baffled them in this Point. The Second Seſſion was appointed to be the Twelfth of <hi>April,</hi> which was then prorogued to the Fourth of <hi>June,</hi> and from thence to the Fifteenth of the ſame Month.

Lanſſac</hi> ſoon after wrote a Letter to give an Account of their being come to the French Reſident at <hi>Rome,</hi> in which he ſaid he thought they ought in the firſt Place to take care that an Event contrary to their Expectation might not attend the Council; that the Pope ſhould Order his <hi>Legates</hi> to ſhew great patience to thoſe who ſpake, proceed ſlowly in all things, attend the Arrival of thoſe Biſhops who were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and allow a Liberty without condition to all that were to Vote or Speak, and not fall under the old Reproach of having <hi>the Holy Ghoſt ſent them from</hi> Rome <hi>in a Portmanteau;</hi> and laſtly, that they ſhould take care that what was Decreed at <hi>Trent</hi> to the Glory of God, ſhould not be malignantly Interpreted and Traduced; or, it may be, Corrupted at <hi>Rome</hi> by a Company of Idle Men: He deſired therefore he would endeavour to obtain theſe things of the Pope, as he did; but the Pope took this Liberty very ill, and deſired, That <hi>no Prejudice might be done to his Authority by the</hi> French <hi>Biſhops.</hi> Adding, That <hi>he reſerved the Reformation of the Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline, and of the Court of</hi> Rome <hi>to himſelf; and that he might with greater Convenience attend this and the Tranſactions at</hi> Trent, <hi>he intended to go to</hi> Bononia. The pretence of this Journey was the Crowning of the Emperor in that City, who was ſaid to be coming thither for that purpoſe: But the reality was, the Pope was afraid the World ſhould think him more ſolicitous for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Papal Power, than for his Paſtoral Cure.
<note place="margin">The Demands of the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors in the Council.</note> The Twentieth of <hi>May</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors were admitted in a Congregation, where they made an unacceptable Oration, an abſtract of which is in <hi>Polano: Thuanus</hi> ſaith, The Speech was made the Fourth of <hi>June,</hi> and that amongſt other things they deſired, That the Miſſals and Breviaries might be Reformed, and the Lectures which were not taken out of the Holy Scriptures might be cut off; That the Sacrament of the Lords Supper might be allowed in both <hi>Kinds</hi> according to the deſire of many Nations; And alſo the Liberty of eating Fleſh, and that the Severity of their Faſts might be abated; That Marriage ſhould be allowed to the Clergy of ſome Countries; That the multitude of Humane Conſtitutions ſhould be retrenched, and Prayers in the Vulgar Tongue faithfully Tranſlated, mixed with the Latin Hymns. Before this the Ambaſſador of the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> had alſo demanded the giving of the Cup in the Lords Supper to the Laity as abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary for the Preſerving thoſe who had not yet ſeparated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but were much offended with this denial, and for the Recovery of thoſe who had left it. And according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there were about Fifty of the moſt Learned of the Fathers of the Council who were for granting it, and amongſt them <hi>Gonzaga</hi> Preſident of the Council, though all his Collegues diſſented. But the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Biſhops oppoſed it, and others thought it was fit firſt to ſend Legates into <hi>Germany</hi> who ſhould ſee and report it to the Council whether it were neceſſary, and how it might be done. This was debated in a Congregation the Twenty eighth of <hi>Auguſt;</hi> but in the Twenty ſecond Seſſion held the Seventeenth of <hi>September</hi> it was rejected, and all were Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matized, <hi>That did not allow the Church to have taken away the Cup from the Laity,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>upon juſt Grounds.</hi> When the <hi>Germans</hi> ſtill inſiſted that it might be granted again to ſome People; the Council to free themſelves from their importunity, turned them over to the Pope, who according to his Prudence was to do what he thought Uſeful and Salutary. Before this the Pope being preſs'd to Grant the <hi>Cup</hi> by the French Ambaſſador about a Year ſince, had referred it to the Conclave of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, and they and he had referred it to the Council; and now the Council ſends it back to the Pope. <hi>Oh the ſtupid Patience of theſe Men!</hi>

            <p>When <hi>Lanſſac</hi> gave the King of <hi>France</hi> an Account of what had been done, he ſaid in his Anſwer, That he liked what had been done as yet at <hi>Trent;</hi> but could not but obſerve that they went very ſlowly about the Reforming of the Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline,
<note place="margin">The <hi>French</hi> Kings Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions on the Proceedings of the Council.</note> and the Manners of the Clergy; and in the mean time were in great haſte to Eſtabliſh the Points of Doctrine; That therefore it was ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected when this was with Levity enough perform'd, there would be an end put to the Council, and no care be taken for the former, that ſo this procedure would afford no Benefit to the Church in this diſtracted State of Chriſtendom, and eſpecially to <hi>France.</hi> That about Thirty Years ſince, when Fire and Sword had ſo unſucceſsfully been imployed to Cure the Diſeaſe, all Men looked upon a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council as the Sheet-Anchor: That he wiſhed nothing had been done in the beginning of this Council for the Alienating the Minds of the Churches Enemies, but rather that they had by all means been allured, and invited to it; and if any had been prevail'd upon to come, that they ſhould have been treated by the Fathers of the Council with Kindneſs and Humanity as Children. For to what end were all theſe careful and diligent Diſquiſitions and Diſputations concerning the Doctrine, ſeeing there was no debate but between the Catholick and Proteſtant in theſe Points? And as to the Proteſtants their Definitions ſignified nothing, but only gave them Occaſion to ſay their Opinions were condemned by the Council without hearing what they had to ſay for them: That therefore it ſeemed more adviſable to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to have brought them into the Council; for fear they ſhould in time withdraw all thoſe who adhere to the Church: For it was a vain furmiſe that the Proteſtants would ever ſubmit to thoſe Decrees which were made when they were abſent. That therefore he was of Opinion, That the Reforming the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Church-men, and the Diſcipline ought to be their firſt and greateſt Care, and the other to be for a time ſuſpended; for this would be acceptable to all Men. And laſtly, <hi>Lanſſac</hi> was ordered to get the next Seſſion Prorogued to the latter end of <hi>October,</hi> 1563. that the <hi>French</hi> Clergy might be preſent at it; or at leaſt that the publiſhing of the Canons might be deferred till then. When <hi>Lanſſac</hi> had repreſented all this to the Council, he deſired in the King's Name, <hi>That ſeeing in the former Seſſions ſome things had been decreed to the prejudice of the Liberties of the</hi> Gallicane Church, <hi>it being an ancient Privilege belonging to them to repreſent by their Kings, or their Ambaſſadors, what they thought uſeful or neceſſary for them, that this Liberty ſhould for the future be preſerved; and that if any thing were Acted to the contrary of it, it might be recalled.</hi> In the mean time, the Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>November,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Clergy arrive at <hi>Trent.</hi>
               </note> the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and about Forty of the <hi>French</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops came to <hi>Trent</hi> with ſome Divines, who were met without that City by the Pope's Legates, and ſome of the other Biſhops, and of the Ambaſſadors. In this Journey the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> went to <hi>Inspruck</hi> to meet the Emperor before he went to the <hi>Diet</hi> at <hi>Francfort</hi> where he had ſome Conferences in private with that Prince about the Affairs of Religion.</p>
            <p>The Pope and the Cardinals at <hi>Rome</hi> were alarm'd at this coming of the <hi>French</hi> Clergy,
<note place="margin">The Pope al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm'd at it, as if ſo many Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded him.</note> as if ſo many Enemies had invaded them, and all things were in an Hurry to make Preparations againſt them. There were new Legates, and a new Squadron of <hi>Italian</hi> Biſhops, who might out number the <hi>French,</hi> preſently to be ſent to <hi>Trent.</hi> And the Pope wrote to King <hi>Philip</hi> to Order the Biſhops of his Dominions to unite their Counſels and Votes with the <hi>Italian</hi> Biſhops, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Reaſons nor the Votes of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ltramontane</hi> Biſhops might prevail againſt them. And in his private Audience with <hi>L' Iſle</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Reſident at <hi>Rome,</hi> he ridicul'd the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> by calling him, <hi>The other Pope who had Three hundred thouſand Pounds the Year Revenue, out of ſeveral Eccleſiaſtical Benefices, when he</hi> (good Man) <hi>was content with the ſingle Biſhoprick of</hi> Rome; <hi>and it is an eaſie thing</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>for the Cardinal with his belly full to praiſe Faſting, and admoniſh others to be content with one Benefice.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> King had ſent <hi>Francis de Bolliers, Sieur de Manes,</hi> to diſſipate and remove this Jealouſie of the Pope's, at the approach of the <hi>French</hi> Biſhops, and to acquaint his <hi>Holineſs</hi> with his Intentions. For that it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſaid, That the Cardinal was ſent to get the Tranſactions in the Conference of <hi>Poiſey</hi> laſt Year confirm'd by the <hi>Synod,</hi> That the Cup might be granted to the Laity, That the Clergy might be allowed Matrimony, That the Liturgy might be in the Vulgar Tongue, That the Biſhops might have but one Dioceſs, and that none ſhould be Elected to that Dignity who could not Preach to the People. As to the firſt <hi>Manes</hi> excuſed the Conference of <hi>Poiſey,</hi> and ſaid, It was appointed by the Queen and the Cardinal for the gaining time, and the retarding or keeping
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:51585:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>back thoſe inteſtine Commotions they foreſaw, and for the ſtopping the Mouths of the Sectaries, who complained every where that their Reaſons had never been heard; <hi>That they deſigned in the Interim to levy Forces ſo that if they could not convince the Sectaries by Reaſon, they might by force reduce them to their Duty.</hi> That nothing was done in that Conference. And as to the other Points the Cardinal and <hi>French</hi> Clergy had no other Inſtructions than what had been ſent to the Ambaſſadors of <hi>France,</hi> and that they brought no prejudged Opinions with them to the Council. The Pope was much concern'd upon the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a Report that the Biſhops of <hi>France</hi> had moved their King to ſtop the Payment of <hi>Firſt Fruits</hi> by the Clergy of <hi>France</hi> to the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> And he ſaid this was contrary to their Pacts and Agreements with him; which was, That this Affair ſhould be tranſacted with the Pope only in a friendly way. But then after all, nothing ſo much ſtartled the holy Man as a Report, that a Peace was treating ſecretly with the Proteſtants, and that they would have Liberty given them to Preach and he foreſaw, that if <hi>France</hi> were once quieted, the Council could not be hurried to a Concluſion, but things would be well conſidered, and perhaps the Proteſtants muſt be heard in it, and amongſt them Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> which he feared beyond Expreſſion. For he thought the Cardinals of <hi>Lorrain</hi> and <hi>Ferrara</hi> were ſo Uſeful and Neceſſary to the King of <hi>France,</hi> that he could never have ſpared them to attend the Council, where there was no need of them if he had not had ſome ſuch peſtilent Deſigns to promote. Whereupon he muſtered up all the Prelates he could poſſibly, not admitting any Excuſe,
<note place="margin">The Popes fears of the <hi>French</hi> Biſhops never to be ſtopp'd.</note> and ſent many alſo who had reſigned their Benefices to the Council, together with the Coadjutors of other Biſhops, that ſo he might have the more Votes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving he was now in the utmoſt degree of Danger; and as if he had not had enough of his own he borrowed ſome Prelates of his Friends too: And amongſt them he got leave of the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> that <hi>Anthony Bobba</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Caſſale,</hi> who was then that Princes Ambaſſador in the Court of <hi>Rome;</hi> and <hi>Lewis Vanini de Teo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolis</hi> Biſhop <hi>de Bertinoro,</hi> a Perſon of great Learning and Eloquence, who had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed his Attendance in the Council upon his want of Health, ſhould now forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with be diſpatched to <hi>Trent.</hi> When this laſt was going thither, he is ſaid to have conſolated and ſtrengthened the good Pope in his Anxiety and Fears of the Event, with an Aſſurance, <hi>That he would certainly get the Victory over the Council,</hi> which was a very Acceptable Saying to the Pope; and that he for that good News Kiſs'd the Biſhop of <hi>Bertinoro,</hi> when he took his Leave to go to <hi>Trent,</hi> bidding him <hi>be careful to get the Victory he had promiſed him.</hi> And when after this ſome flying Reports came to <hi>Rome,</hi> that ſome Queſtions were moved in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil to the prejudice of the Papal Authority by the Biſhops, he was ſo moved at it, that in the Conſiſtory before all the Cardinals, he cried out, <hi>he and the Romans were betrayed, whileſt he maintained an Army of Enemies at</hi> Trent <hi>with great expence.</hi> By which expreſſion he aimed at the <hi>Italian</hi> Biſhops, who were his Penſioners, and kept there by him in great numbers. And <hi>Jo.

I ſhall not here trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Reader with them. The 10th. of <hi>January</hi> the King of <hi>France</hi> ordered his Ambaſſador to aſſure the Pope that the <hi>Annals</hi> which were taken away in the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the States of <hi>France,</hi> lately held at <hi>Orleans,</hi> ſhould for the future be paid to the Pope; he hoping by this means to have him more ready to grant his deſires, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the peace of the Church, which the Pope's Ambaſſador largely promiſed. On the 14th. of <hi>February</hi> a Decree was made concerning the Reſidence of Biſhops and Paſtors with great difficulty and oppoſition, which all tended to the obtaining the Judgment of the Council, <hi>That the Pope has full power to feed, and govern the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Church.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> who hold that a Council is above the Pope, were contented to conceal their opinion in this point, for fear the Pope ſhould take that opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to diſſolve the Council, without any good done by it. But then they were reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to defend their ſaid opinion if it were oppoſed whatever happened, and upon no terms to loſe or yield it. King <hi>Philip</hi> alſo laboured very hard that the power of the Biſhops ſhould be raiſed, and that of the Pope and the Conclave brought lower; which they of the Pope's party interpreted as a deſign to diminiſh the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, becauſe the Biſhops and Chapters of <hi>Spain</hi> would be more ſubjected to the will of the King than the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> would. By which means they at laſt prevailed ſo far upon that jealous Nation, that the power of the Biſhops in the end was very much abated, and that of the Pope was enlarged and exalted; and the Biſhops were contented to act as the Popes Delegates, and by his Authority, and in his Name to exerciſe their Functions. About this time it was that the Cardinal of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi> went again to the Emperor to <hi>Inſpruck,</hi> which cauſed a great fear in the Pope's party in the Council, for that they ſuſpected he went to adjuſt with that Prince the ways to bring the Papal power under.</p>

               <note place="margin">The Emperor diſlikes the Proceedings of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.</note> who went to <hi>Inſpruck</hi> to him) wherein he ſignified to his Holineſs, <q>That after his Son in the laſt Diet was Elected King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and Crown'd, and that he had viſited his Cities upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi> he was come to <hi>Inſpruck</hi> to promote the Affairs of the Church in the Council as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the Supreme Advocate and Procurator of the Church; but that to his great grief he underſtood that things were ſo far from going as was to be deſired, and as the publick State of Affairs required, that it was to be feared, if ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy remedies were not applied, the Council would be ended in ſuch manner, as it would give offence to all <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and become ridiculous to all thoſe who had made a defection from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and fix them more obſtinately in thoſe opinions they had embraced, tho' very differing from the Orthodox Faith. That there had not been any Seſſion celebrated for a long time, and that it was commonly given out, the Fathers and Doctors in the Council, had contentions and differences amongſt themſelves, which were unworthy of that moderation which they ought to have, and tended very much to the detriment of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord which was hoped for from them; and yet theſe conteſts frequently broke out to the great ſatisfaction of their Adverſaries: That there was a report, That the Pope intended to diſſolve or ſuſpend the Council; and he adviſed him not to do it, becauſe nothing could be more ſhameful or damageable; and which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, would certainly cauſe a great defection from the Church, and bring a great hatred on the Papacy, and from thence cauſe an equal contempt of all the Clergy; That this diſſolution or ſuſpenſion would certainly procure the Aſſembling of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Councils, which the Popes have ever oppoſed as contrary to the Unity of the Church, and which thoſe Princes which were well affected to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> had hitherto hindred in their Dominions; but after this they could find no pretence to deny or delay them any longer. Therefore he deſired the Pope to lay aſide that thought, and to apply himſelf ſeriouſly to the celebration of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, allowing the Ancient Liberty to all in its full extent, that all things might be diſpatched rightly, lawfully, and in order, and thereby the mouths of their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, who ſought an opportunity to calumniate, might be ſtopp'd. That it

            <p>The 21th. of <hi>May</hi> the <hi>Count de Luna,</hi> Ambaſſador for the King of <hi>Spain,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of <hi>Spain</hi> received in the Council.</note> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in a Congregation; and there was a Speech made in the behalf of that Prince in the Aſſembly, by one <hi>Pedro Fontidonio de Segovia</hi> a Divine, who extoll'd above meaſure the care of his Maſter in the Affairs of Religion, and eſpecially his ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſhewn towards Sectaries; he ſaid this Prince Married <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> only to the end he might reſtore the Catholick Religion in that flouriſhing Kingdom. He Reproached the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>German</hi> Nations, for thinking that much was to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged to the Hereticks, that being won by theſe Conceſſions they might be reduced into the boſom of the Church. At laſt he ſaid, That they ought ſo to conſult the Salvation of Hereticks, and the Majeſty of the Church, that all things might be done for the promoting the latter, rather than for gratifying the former. And he exhorted all Princes to imitate the ſeverity of his Maſter in bridling Hereticks, that the Church might be delivered from ſo many Miſeries, and the Fathers of <hi>Trent</hi> from the care of celebrating Councils.</p>
            <p>A little before this time the news of the Peace made with the Proteſtants of <hi>France,</hi> came firſt in Generals, and ſoon after the particular Articles.
<note place="margin">The Fathers at <hi>Trent</hi> much diſſatisfied with the Peace made in <hi>France.</hi>
               </note> This was <q>blamed by the greater part of the Fathers in that Council, who ſaid it was to prefer the things of the world before the things of God; yea to ruin both the one and the other. For the Foundation of a State, which is Religion, being removed, it is neceſſary that the Temporal ſhould come to deſolation; whereof the Edict made before was an example, which did not cauſe Peace and Tranquility, as was hoped, but a greater War than before.</q> The truth is, theſe men would have all the world fight out their quarrel to the laſt man, and then if their Catholicks periſh, they are as unconcerned as for the Hereticks; and accordingly ever ſince that time they have made it their buſineſs firſt to hinder all Treaties of Peace, wherein any li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty was granted to the Proteſtants; and when they could not gain that point, to make them be broken as ſoon as was poſſible; tho this too has for the moſt part turn'd in the end to their great loſs and ſhame.
<note place="margin">The <hi>French</hi> Court ſhew their Reaſons for it.</note> The <hi>French</hi> Court perceiving how the Fathers of <hi>Trent</hi> took the Peace, Ordered the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> to ſhew the great Dangers which from the Civil War threatned that Kingdom; and to aſſure the Council that it was the intention of the King <hi>to diſſipate the Factions of</hi> France <hi>by a Peace, that he might be at leiſure to attend ſeriouſly the reſtitution of the Peace of the Church.</hi> But when this would not be allowed <q>neither, the Queen ſent <hi>Renate de Birague,</hi> Preſident of <hi>Dauphine,</hi> to aſſure the Fathers, That their Intentions were not to ſettle a New Religion in <hi>France,</hi> nor to ſuffer it to grow up and encreaſe, but that having diſarmed their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and quieted the Tumults, they might with the leſs trouble return to the Methods uſed by their Anceſtors, for the reducing their people into the way, and the Unity of the ſame Catholick Religion. That this could never be done but by the Authority of a lawful and free, either General or National Council: that a General Council ſeemed the ſafer way, but then it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that a liberty and ſecurity ſhould be given to all that would to come. That tho' this had been done by the Pope and the Fathers; yet the place was ſuch; and ſo ſituate, that being rather in <hi>Italy</hi> than <hi>Germany,</hi> the Proteſtants could not think themſelves ſufficiently ſecure. For they deſired a Council in <hi>Germany,</hi> and thought they were not ſafe if it were any where elſe: That not only they of <hi>Germany,</hi> but the <hi>Engliſh, Scotch, Danes</hi> and <hi>Swedes,</hi> were of the ſame mind, and it was very unjuſt to condemn ſo many Nations unheard, and beſides it was unprofitable too, for whereas all good men hoped that this Council would procure an Unity, on the contrary it would cauſe a greater op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and enmity, when theſe Nations ſaw themſelves neglected; and by the inconvenience of the place, as it were excluded out of the Council. For it was fit for none but weak and credulous men to think they would ever ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Decrees of a Council in which they had never been admitted, nor heard; but it was to be feared on the other ſide that their minds being exaſperated, their patience would turn to fury, and they would traduce to Poſterity the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:51585:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>Decrees of the Council; and in the preſent age treat them with a virulent ſharpneſs in their Writings. Therefore <hi>Birague</hi> was Ordered to deſire the Council might by the conſent of the Fathers and Pope be transferr'd into <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> to <hi>Worms, Spire, Baſil</hi> or <hi>Conſtance.</hi> This Diſcourſe would not edifie at <hi>Trent,</hi> and he was ſent on the ſame Errand to <hi>Inſpruck</hi> to the Emperor, and to <hi>Vienna</hi> to his Son <hi>Maximilian.</hi> There were two others ſent at the ſame time, one into <hi>Spain,</hi> and another to <hi>Rome;</hi> but this latter found the Pope enraged to the utmoſt with the Peace, ſo that he was reſolved to treat <hi>France</hi> without any favour.</q>

            <p>In order to this,
<note place="margin">The Pope's Bull to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quifitors.</note> the Pope puts out a Bull dated the 7th. of <hi>April,</hi> by which <q>he grants power to the <hi>Cardinals,</hi> appointed <hi>Inquiſitors General for all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> to proceed ſmartly and extrajudicially, as ſhall ſeem convenient to them againſt all and ſingular the Hereticks, and their Abettors and Receivers, and thoſe who are ſuſpected to be ſuch abiding in the Provinces and places in which the filth of the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Hereſie hath prevailed; and to which it is notorious, there is not a ſafe and free entrance; tho' the ſaid perſons are adorn'd with the Epiſcopal, Archiepiſcopal, Patriarchal Dignity, or Cardinalate, without any other proof to be made of the ſafety or freedom of the Acceſs.

That the danger which threatned her was of ill example, and might in time be extended to any of them, and therefore they were all bound to aſſiſt and defend her in this common cauſe, and the more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe was a Widow. 3. But the King of <hi>France</hi> above all other, becauſe nearly related to her, and her late Husband, who was one of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Princes of the Blood Royal, and had loſt his Life in his ſervice in the laſt War againſt the <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> leaving his Children Orphans, the Eldeſt of which was now in the King's Court, and under his care: That the King could not neglect the cauſe of this ſorrowful Widow, and her Orphan and Children, who appeal'd to his fidelity, and the Memory of his Anceſtors; who had in all times of affliction ſuccoured the Princes of <hi>Germany, Spain,</hi> and <hi>England.</hi> That <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Bold,</hi> the Son of St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> had with a potent Army defended an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan-Queen of <hi>Navarr,</hi> and brought her into <hi>France,</hi> where ſhe was after Married to <hi>Philip the Fair,</hi> from whom <hi>Joan</hi> the preſent Queen of <hi>Navarr</hi> was lineally deſcended. And that <hi>John Labrett</hi> the Grandfather of this Queen being in like manner perſecuted by one of the Popes, and driven out of a part of his Kingdom; the reſt had been defended and preſerved by <hi>Lewis</hi> the Twelfth, and his Succeſſors. That the Popes themſelves have heretofore fled to the <hi>French</hi>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:51585:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>for protection when they have been expelled out of their Sees, who had often reſtored them, defended and enriched them with the grant of many Territories: That this Queen was ſo near a Neighbour, and ſuch an Allie to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> that no War could be made upon her without the great damage of <hi>France:</hi> That all Princes were Intereſted in the Friendſhip and Peace of their Neighbours, and obliged to keep all Wars at a diſtance from them for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of their own quiet and ſecurity. Since therefore his Majeſty ſaw by this Bull that there was a deſign to deprive his Ancient Allies of their Dominions, and at pleaſure to ſet up others in their ſtead, he had juſt reaſon to fear that as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had heretofore on ſuch pretences poſſeſs'd themſelves of all the Countries to the <hi>Pyrenaean Hills,</hi> ſo that in time they might paſs them too, and deſcend into the Plains of <hi>France,</hi> and ſo a diſmal and deſtructive War might be rekindled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe powerful Princes, to the great hazard and ruin of <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi> Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Queen of <hi>Navarr</hi> being a Feuditary of the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> and having great Poſſeſſions in that Kingdom, was under the Protection of the Laws of it, and could not be drawn out of it to <hi>Rome,</hi> either in Perſon, or by Proxy; no Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of <hi>France</hi> being bound to go to <hi>Rome;</hi> but if the Pope had any cauſe againſt them, he was obliged to ſend Judges to determine upon the place even in thoſe Caſes that came before him by Appeal. That therefore this Citation was againſt the Majeſty, Law, and Security of the Crown of <hi>France;</hi> and tended to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing of the eſteem of that King and Kingdom. That if the Form of this Proceeding were conſidered, what could be more contrary to the Civil Law than to force a man out of his proper Court, and condemn him in another without any hearing? For there are Laws, That no accuſed perſon ſhall be cited out of the Limits of the Juriſdiction in which he lives, and that the Citation ſhall not be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure and perfunctory, but declared to the proper perſon, or to his family. And the Conſtitution of Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the Eighth, That Citations ſet up in certain places of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould be of force, was recall'd by <hi>Clement</hi> the Fifth, and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Venna,</hi> as hard and unjuſt, or at leaſt mitigated; and it was decreed that they ſhould not be uſed, but when there was no ſafe coming to the perſon accuſed: But in <hi>France,</hi> where the Queen of <hi>Navarr</hi> reſides, it cannot be pretended that there is no ſafe coming to her. And what can be more contrary to Natural Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty than to condemn unheard? It is forbidden by the Canons and Decrees of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, and there is a noble example of this in <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus,</hi> where Pope <hi>Liberius,</hi> being urged by <hi>Conſtantius</hi> to condemn <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> choſe rather to be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, than to ſentence him without hearing. And in the Judgment againſt <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Third, who was accuſed of Inceſt, <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Emperor obſerved the ſame method, and made him appear and anſwer in a <hi>Synod</hi> before Fifty Biſhops. For the ſame reaſon the Sentence of <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Firſt, againſt <hi>Lotharius</hi> the Son of St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> for having two Wives, was thought void and null. Nor was this Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt the Queen of <hi>Navarr</hi> of better force, becauſe ſhe was abſent and unheard. That the Popes have always ſhewn that reſpect to Crown'd heads, as to admoniſh them by their Legates, before they decreed ought againſt them. So <hi>Alexander</hi> the Third ſent two Cardinals to <hi>Henry</hi> the Second into <hi>England,</hi> when he was accuſed of the Death of <hi>Thomas a Becket</hi> A.B. of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> That he might purge himſelf before them of this crime. So of late <hi>Clement</hi> the Seventh, did the like in the caſe of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, to whom he ſent Cardinal <hi>Campeius.</hi> And if it were granted that the Judgment were rightly paſſed, how could the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions of the Queen be expoſed for a prey, and given to the firſt Invader, they belonging to the King as Lord of the Fee? Therefore the King believes that the Pope is deceived by falſe reports, and inſtigated by the craft of his Miniſters, who not regarding the publick peace, have drawn him from his natural goodneſs, to Counſels which are diſhonourable to his Holineſs, and deſtructive to his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and to that of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> tending to the alienating of the hearts of his friends from him, and the diſturbing of the Peace of <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi> And his Majeſty is the more perſwaded of the truth of this, becauſe his Holineſs ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly eſpouſed the Intereſt of <hi>Anthony</hi> the Husband of this Queen in his life-time; and endeavoured to perſwade King <hi>Philip</hi> to reſtore to him the Kingdom of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varr,</hi> or at leaſt to give him the Iſland of <hi>Sardinia</hi> as an <hi>Equivalent.</hi> But then there is nothing more offends the King than the conſidering that whereas ſo many Kings, Princes, and Free States above Forty years ſince have defected from the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and committed the offence charged upon the Queen, and ſo by the rule of Juſtice ought to be firſt puniſhed as firſt offending; yet the Pope has
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:51585:48"/>not proceeded in the ſame way, or with equal ſeverity againſt any of them; ſo that from hence it is clear that an occaſion is ſought by her enemies to oppreſs and ruin her by ſurprize, whileſt ſhe is a Widow, her Children Orphans, the King of <hi>France</hi> who ought to protect her being a Minor, and diſturbed by Civil Wars; and for this reaſon the King is the more obliged to defend her from injury, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from contempt, ſeeing without acquainting him with it, they have begun this Proceſs againſt a Queen ſo nearly related to him. That if this Accuſation had been made on the account of Religion, and for the Glory of God, the Pope ought in the firſt place to have ſhewn his care of her ſoul, and from the <hi>Word of God</hi> to have adminiſtred fitting Remedies, and not to have proſcribed her King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Dominions,
<note place="margin">The Depoſing of Princes, and diſpoſing of their Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, the cauſe of great Calamities.</note> and given them for a prey to the firſt Invader. The Pope has a Supremacy given him, That he may conſult the Salvation of Souls, and the repoſe of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and not that he may deprive Princes of their Kingdoms, and diſpoſe of their poſſeſſions at his pleaſure; which the former Popes have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been able to do in <hi>Germany</hi> and other places, without bringing great reproach and diſhonour on the Church, and diſturbances upon the World. That therefore the King deſired with the greateſt humility that he could or ought, that the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt the Q. of <hi>Navarr</hi> ſhould be revok'd, and all the Pope's Miniſters ſhould be inhibited from proceeding in this cauſe by a publick Act; and if this were not done, the King ſhould be forced againſt his will to make uſe of the ſame reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies his Anceſtors had imployed in the like caſes, according to the Laws and Rights of his Kingdom. But before all things he proteſted he ſhould do this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly, and therefore they only ſhould bear the blame who by their raſhneſs had forced him to uſe the power God had given him, in ſo juſt a cauſe, and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the aſſiſtance of his friends againſt them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>There was at the ſame time diſtinct Memorials, and larger Inſtructions ſent to the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador for the Defence of the Biſhops,
<note place="margin">The Biſhops defended by the King alſo.</note> and <hi>D'Oyſel</hi> who was an active Miniſter, prevail'd upon the Pope to have the Proceedings againſt the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops ſtopt, and the Sentence againſt the Queen of <hi>Navarr</hi> revok'd and aboliſhed. So that at this day it is not to be found amongſt the Conſtitutions of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the Fourth. The 18th. of <hi>May</hi> there having been no conſideration had of the XXXIII. Articles put into the Council the 4th. of <hi>January,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Queen complains of the Procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the Council.</note> the Queen wrote to <hi>Lanſſac</hi> her Ambaſſador, complaining very bitterly of the delays and ſhifts which had been made in this buſineſs, and ſaid that the hope good men had hitherto had of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of this Council, and the opinion of their ſincerity who met in it, would both vaniſh without any fruit, and their diſſimulation and connivance would more and more inflame the wrath of God againſt us, who had now made it manifeſt unto all men that the affairs of the Church needed a Reformation, and a ſevere correction; and to that purpoſe had invited and brought together from all parts of the Earth, ſo many men famous for their Piety and Learning to this Council; and if after all <q>this he ſhall ſee us ſtill ſtubbornly reſiſt his will; he will be neceſſitated to puniſh thoſe men who have hindred ſo good a work, and ſo neceſſary to the peace of the Church: That therefore the King had wrote to the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> to aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Congregation of the <hi>French</hi> Clergy, and after a mature deliberation had amongſt themſelves to demand earneſtly of the Fathers of the Council that theſe things might be conſidered and determin'd as ſoon as was poſſible.</q> But the Cardinal was by this time won over to the Pope's ſide,
<note place="margin">The Pope gained the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> to his ſide,</note> and was willing to ſacrifice the ſafety of <hi>France,</hi> and the King's Will, to the Intereſt of the former. In order to this he delayed the Execution of his Orders from day to day; and at laſt that he might totally diſappoint them, asked leave of the King to go to <hi>Rome,</hi> believing the Kings Ambaſſadors would do nothing in his abſence. And not long after <hi>Lanſſac</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained leave to return into <hi>France.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Who went to <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note> The Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> went from <hi>Trent</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Rome</hi> the 18th of <hi>September,</hi> and with him five of the <hi>French</hi> Biſhops: But the other <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors did nevertheleſs inſiſt ſtoutly to have the Articles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered by the Council; who, that they might elude this purſuit, made ſome Decrees which had ſome reſpect to thoſe things the <hi>French</hi> had deſired, but which aimed at the granting a Liberty and Immunity to the Clergy againſt all the Laws, Privileges, Liberties, and Juriſdictions, and Lawful Authorities of all Kingdoms, States and Princes; which being ſeen by <hi>La Ferriere</hi> and <hi>Du Faur</hi> the King's Ambaſſadors at <q>
                  <hi>Trent</hi> they by their Maſter's Order oppoſed the ſaid Decrees. The 27th. of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> the King by a Letter having commanded his Ambaſſadors to inſiſt upon their firſt Demands; and to aſſure the Council, that as none of the Chriſtian Princes ſhould exceed him in the fervor of true Piety, and a deſire to promote the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:51585:48"/>Affairs of the Council, ſo if they ſtill went on to cure the deſperate wounds of the Church with a light hand, or rather to plaſter them over, and conceal, than cure them, whileſt they omitted the proper and moſt neceſſary remedies, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of conſidering the Reformation of the Church, turn'd the edge of their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority againſt the Power of Princes, and the Decrees of Councils, he would not have the Preſence of his Ambaſſadors add Authority to ſuch unjuſt Decrees to the great prejudice of his Royal Dignity, and to the Damage of the Liberties of his Kingdom. He ſaid alſo that he had been informed that the Council had enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a deſign to declare the Marriage of <hi>Anthony de Bourbon</hi> King of <hi>Navarr,</hi> and <hi>Joan</hi> his Queen unlawful, and to declare <hi>Henry</hi> his Son a Baſtard; and he commanded them not to be preſent at any ſuch Act. Laſtly, he commanded them to repeat their former demands; and if the Fathers of the Council would not grant them, then to leave <hi>Trent,</hi> and go to <hi>Venice,</hi> and ſtay there till they had further Orders from him. He told them alſo that his principal deſire was by a ſerious Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Church-affairs and manners, (the corruptions in which had cauſed ſo many to make defection from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) by the Authority of a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, to unite the divided minds of men in the matters of Religion. That his Ambaſſadors and Proctors had often treated with the Pope, and the Fathers of the Council about this; and to that end had exhibited the ſaid XXXIV. Articles, to which no ſatisfactory return had been made, but on the contrary, they having lightly touched the buſineſs of Reformation, had exerciſed an Authority which belonged not to them, againſt the Rights,
<note place="margin">The Council has no Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over Princes.</note> Liberties and Power of Soveraign Princes. That they neither could nor ought to inquire into the Civil Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was not ſubject to their Court, nor to derogate from thoſe Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Cuſtoms which had been long enjoyed by Princes; nor to Anathematize Kings; all which things tended to Sedition, and the interruption of the publick Peace: That he would not ſuffer that Authority which he had received from his Anceſtors to be weakned by their unjuſt cenſures. Yea, he commanded them to tell the Fathers, That if they preſumed any more to undermine the Authority of Kings, and the <hi>Prerogatives of their Betters,</hi> that they ſhould then alſo proteſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their proceeding, and leave <hi>Trent:</hi> Adviſing the Biſhops and Divines of <hi>France,</hi> who were in the Council to promote the Reformation of Religion as much as was poſſible for the good of his divided Kingdom, and to that end to ſtay ſtill at <hi>Trent.</hi> But then the King did truſt to their wiſdom and conſcience, that they would not approve of by their preſence, or conſent to any thing which was preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to the Royal Authority, Prerogative or Dignity of the King or Kingdom of <hi>France.</hi>
               </q> But however the Council ſtill perſiſting in their former Methods, <hi>La Ferriere</hi> came into the Council, and made a ſharp Oration againſt the Pope and the Council. <hi>Polano</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 721.</note> in his Hiſtory of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> has the ſum of this Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and <hi>Thuanus</hi> ſaith it was pronounced the 22d. of <hi>September.</hi> But however, I will not trouble the Reader with it here, becauſe of its great length; this Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion pleaſed none of the Fathers; the <hi>French</hi> themſelves not excepted, becauſe he ſet Princes as the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of God, above the <hi>Anathema's</hi> of the Clergy, and made both their perſons and revenues ſubject to the Laws and Authority of Kings; telling them too plainly of their great prevarications, obſtinacy and unwillingneſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, or be reformed.</p>
            <p>But however, all the Fathers could do, was to bring the Faith of the Ambaſſadors in queſtion, which they ſoon diſcuſs'd by producing their Inſtructions. This failing, they cavell'd at the parts of the Oration, and endeavoured to pervert the ſenſe and meaning of it; ſo that <hi>Ferriere</hi> was forced to publiſh an <hi>Apology</hi> for it. And ſoon after this they mended the matter by a ſharper Oration, in which amongſt other things they told the Council plainly,
<note place="margin">The Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of <hi>France</hi> put a ſeveret Proteſtation into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.</note> 
               <hi>That</hi> Hadrian <hi>the Sixth was in the right when he told the world, That what care ſoever was taken of the lower members of the Church, that body could not be reſtored to its health, if the Head alſo (the Pope) were not reformed.</hi> Towards the end they ſaid, <hi>They proteſted only againſt</hi> Pius <hi>the Fourth; They Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated the Apoſtolick See, the great</hi> Pontiff, <hi>the Holy Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>for the increaſe of whoſe Dignity their Anceſtors had ſo often ſhed their blood, and of late had fought in</hi> France; <hi>but it was againſt the Soveraignty of</hi> Pius <hi>the Fourth, that they proteſted; all whoſe Decrees and Sentences they refuſed and deſpiſed; and ſeeing there was nothing done at</hi> Trent, <hi>but all was diſpatched at</hi> Rome; <hi>and what was here publiſhed, was rather the Dictates of</hi> Pius <hi>the Fourth, than the Decrees of a General Council; they denounced and teſtified, That whatever was decreed in that Convention, or ſhould hereafter be decreed or publiſhed, they being only the Decrees moved by</hi> Pius <hi>the Fourth, they ſhould not be approved by the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:51585:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>Most Chriſtian King, nor the</hi> French, <hi>nor be taken for the Acts of a General Council. And then commanded all their Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Abbots and Divines to return into</hi> France <hi>till God ſhould reſtore to the Catholick Church the ancient form and liberty belonging of right to General Councils, and to the Moſt Chriſtian King his juſt Rights. Thuanus</hi> ſaith, he can hardly believe this Oration was made, tho' he finds it Printed in the Commentaries of <hi>Jacques de Bourdin</hi> Secretary of State. But however it ſhews the ſenſe great men had of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> at that time when it was beſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.</p>
            <p>A little before this time the Emperor being about leaving <hi>Inſpruck,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Emperor oppoſeth the intended Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the Council againſt Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
               </note> diſcovered that they conſulted at <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Trent</hi> about proceeding againſt Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> and he wrote to the Pope and the Legates, that if the Council would not yield that fruit which was deſired that they might ſee an Union of Catholicks to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Church; yet at leaſt they ſhould not give occaſion to Hereticks to unite themſelves more, which they would do in caſe they proceeded againſt the Queen of <hi>England.</hi> For undoubtedly they would then make a General League againſt the Catholicks, which would be the cauſe of great Inconveniences. We may ſee by this how hardly this Holy Council was kept from giving the world a Caſt of its of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in depoſing Princes, and diſpoſing of their Dominions, and abſolving their Subjects from their Allegiance; tho' we are now told, this is none of the Doctrines of that Church; but however, it is undoubtedly her practice. This Admonition was ſo effectual that the Pope deſiſted at <hi>Rome,</hi> and revoked the Commiſſion given to that purpoſe to the Legates at <hi>Trent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors had put theſe two Rubs in the way of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
<note place="margin">The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors leave <hi>Trent,</hi> and go to <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice.</hi>
               </note> they retired, as the King their Maſter had before commanded them, to <hi>Venice;</hi> and gave an account of what they had done to the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and to the King of <hi>France;</hi> this laſt approved it, but the former having made his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Market with the Pope, who extremely flattered this proud, turbulent, vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious Prelate, was very much diſpleaſed with what the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors had done in his abſence at <hi>Trent.</hi> But when he came there and found the Ambaſſadors were ſupported by the King, and that there was no fetching them back from <hi>Venice</hi> till the things propoſed by the Council were revoked, he perſwaded the Legates to compound the difference, and the Infallible Council laid by theſe Decrees which diſpleaſed the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> and paſſed only a general Decree againſt the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters of the Eccleſiaſtical privileges and Immunities in the Twenty fifth Seſſion. This was the laſt Seſſion of this Council,
<note place="margin">The laſt Seffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi>
               </note> and was held the fifth and ſixth of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi> In it was determin'd the points concerning Purgatory, the Invocation of Saints, the Worſhip of Images and Reliques, the Prohibition of Duels, and all that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd to the Reformation of the Manners of the Clergy. All that had been done under <hi>Paul</hi> the Third, <hi>Julius</hi> the Third, and two Years before this, in this Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were then alſo ratified and confirmed. And the Pope was deſired to approve the ſame, and ſo the Council was diſmiſſed with Acclamations. The Pope made a grave Oration in a Conclave of the Cardinals, and giving God unfeigned thanks that the Council was ended, he commended the Emperor, the Apoſtolick Legates and the Biſhops; and ſaid, <hi>Tho' he was tree from the obligation of all Laws, yet he would cauſe theſe to be exactly and inviolably preſerved, and if any thing was omitted he would ſupply it.</hi> The Proteſtant Miniſters of <hi>Germany</hi> at the ſame time put out a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation againſt this Council, ſubſcribed by many of them.</p>
            <p>Thus ended the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The cenſure of the Council.</note> which was deſired and procured by <hi>Godly men</hi> to reunite the Church which began to be <hi>divided, but hath ſo eſtabliſhed the Schiſm, and made the parties ſo obſtinate, that the diſcords are become irreconcileable. And being inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Princes for the reformation of the Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline, hath cauſed the greateſt corruption and deformation that ever was ſince Chriſtianity began: The Biſhops hoped to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the Epiſcopal Authority, uſurped for the moſt part by the Pope; and it hath made them loſe it altogether, bringing them into greater ſervitude. On the contrary it was feared and avoided by the See of</hi> Rome <hi>as a potent means to moderate their exorbitant power, which from ſmall beginnings mounted by divers degrees to an unlimited exceſs; and it hath ſo eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed and confirm'd the ſame over that part which remains ſubject unto it; that it was never ſo great, nor ſo ſoundly rooted.</hi> Thus far <hi>Polano.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Emperor who was come as far as <hi>Inſpruck</hi> to promote the Council,
<note place="margin">The Emperor goes from <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpruck</hi> before the Council was ended.</note> finding that his being there did not only no good, as he thought it would, but rather the contrary; the Popiſh Prelates ſuſpecting his deſigns were againſt the Authority of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and were accordingly afraid of every thing, ſo that the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and Suſpicions did turn into bitterneſs, and encreaſe in number. Therefore ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:51585:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>other buſineſs which would turn more to his Advantage, he left that place and returned home; but he wrote firſt to the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,
<note place="margin">His ſenſe of the Council.</note> That the Impoſſibility of doing good in the Council being palpable, he thought it was the duty of a Chriſtian and wiſe Prince, rather to ſupport the preſent evil with patience, than by labouring to cure it, to cauſe a greater.</hi> By which he ſeems to mean that any enormities were to be endured from the See of <hi>Rome</hi> rather than to forſake it, and ſo correct them.</p>
            <p>The Catholick Princes being blinded and miſled by their Education,
<note place="margin">The Reaſons why the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil had no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſucceſs.</note> and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding that the right of calling Councils was in themſelves, as it was of old in the Chriſtian Emperors, who call'd all the Ancient General Councils, thought that they ſhould by force of Arguments and modeſty, extort ſome Reformation from them, but when they ſaw they could not agree amongſt themſelves what was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary, <hi>France</hi> and the Empire asking more than King <hi>Philip</hi> was willing to admit, and the Pope being as ſtoutly reſolved whatever happened not to ſuffer his Power, Grandeur or Wealth to be abated. Laſtly, when they all ſaw that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants would never ſubmit to any Council that was call'd and managed by the Pope or his Legates, they all became weary of it, and deſired it might be ended as ſoon as was poſſible, and any way to deliver themſelves from the charge, trouble, and vexation of this unprofitable, or rather miſchievous Conventicle.</p>
            <p>But then as to the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks of this Age, who would fain perſwade us that nothing was amiſs; that there was no need of any Reformation; that all the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences aroſe from miſrepreſenting the Doctrines and Practices of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and that this Council was one of the moſt holy Aſſemblies of Learned, Impartial and Religious men that ever ſate. Theſe I ſay are a a pleaſant parcel of Gentlemen, and preſume that we are as ignorant of, and unconcern'd for the Hiſtories of former times, as thoſe who profeſs to be led by an implicite faith in all they have the confidence to teach them; which is a great miſtake.</p>
            <p>From this day forward the Proteſtants renounced all commerce and friendſhip with the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and ſhe has by this Council put her ſelf out of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of a Reconciliation; ſo that now the Quarrel is put intirely into the hands of God, and all humane wiſdom is baffl'd for ever. Time, the Sword, or the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God may perhaps at laſt put an end to it, but no Counſel or Device of men ever ſhall.</p>
            <p>I ſhould here have ended this Continuation,
<note place="margin">The State of Religion in <hi>Piedmont.</hi>
               </note> but that I have been forced to leave ſome things unſpoken to continue the thread of my Relation, which I will now go back to and gather up, that the Story may be the more compleat and perfect. Whileſt the Council was ſitting, the Cardinal of <hi>Ferrara</hi> travelling through <hi>Piedmont</hi> and <hi>Savoy,</hi> found the Affairs of that Country as to Religion not much other than in <hi>France.</hi> In divers places of the <hi>Marquiſate</hi> of <hi>Saluzza,</hi> all the Prieſts were hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted away; and in <hi>Cherie</hi> and <hi>Cuni,</hi> places belonging to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and in many other Cities near unto them, many were of the ſame opinions with the <hi>Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots,</hi> and many even in the Duke's Court alſo did profeſs them, and more were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered every day. And however the Duke had ſet forth a Proclamation a Month before; <hi>That all that followed thoſe opinions ſhould within eight days depart out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> and ſome did thereupon depart, yet afterwards he commanded there ſhould be no proceedings againſt them, and pardon'd many who were condemn'd by the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition,</hi> and made their Proceſs void, as alſo thoſe who were in the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> and not condemn'd; and gave leave to ſome that were departed to return.</p>
            <p>About the ſame time there hapned a great tumult, and popular commotion in <hi>Bavaria,</hi> becauſe the Cup was not allowed, nor Married men ſuffered to preach;
<note place="margin">A Tumult in <hi>Bavaria</hi> for the Cup.</note> which diſorder proceeded ſo far, that to appeaſe them, the <hi>Duke</hi> promiſed in the <hi>Diet,</hi> That if in all the Month of <hi>June</hi> a reſolution were not made in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> or by the Pope, to give them ſatisfaction, he himſelf would grant both the one and the other. The news of this coming to the Council, the Legates diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched <hi>Nicholas Ormonet</hi> to perſwade the Duke not to make that Grant. To whom the Duke replied, That to ſhew his obedience to the Apoſtolick See, he would uſe all means to entertain his people as long as he could, expecting and hoping that the Council would reſolve that which they ſaw to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, notwithſtanding the Reſolution made before by it.
<note place="margin">Reaſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Marriage to the Clergy.</note> But the Council had good reaſon to deny this laſt, becauſe (ſay they) it is plain that Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Prieſts will turn their affections and love to their Wives and Children; and by conſequence to their Houſe and Country, and ſo that ſtrict depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance which the Clergy hath on the Apoſtolick <hi>See,</hi> would ceaſe; and to grant
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:51585:50"/>Marriage to Prieſts would deſtroy the Eccleſiaſtical <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> and make the Pope to be a Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> only. And in another place they tell us that having Houſe, Wife and Children, they (the Clergy) will not depend on the <hi>Pope,</hi> but on their <hi>Prince;</hi> and their love to their Children, will make them yield to any prejudice of the Church; and they will ſeek to make the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices Hereditary, and ſo in a ſhort ſpace the Authority of the Apoſtolick <hi>See</hi> will be co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<note place="margin">The <hi>French</hi> Affairs after the Peace till the end of the Council.</note> the true reaſon why the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> clapt up this Peace upon ſuch eaſie and diſadvantageous terms, was becauſe he had been deluded by the Queen with the vain hopes of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding his Brother the King of <hi>Navarr,</hi> as General of all the Forces of <hi>France;</hi> and that he ſhould marry the Queen of <hi>Scotland</hi> too, which he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards refuſed.</p>

               <note place="margin">The Siege of <hi>Havre de Grace.</hi>
               </note> and had a Garriſon in it; and now both the Proteſtants and the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks united their Forces to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive them of it, without repaying any of the Money the Queen had expended in the War, or conſidering what need they might after have of that Princeſs's prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and aſſiſtance. Both parties on the contrary proteſt, That if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> do not forthwith reſtore that place, they ſhould forfeit their Right to <hi>Calais,</hi> which was reſerved to them by the Treaty of <hi>Cambray;</hi> and when this would not do, they proclaimed a War againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in <hi>France</hi> the 7th. of <hi>July;</hi> which was return'd them by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> till they ſhould reſtore <hi>Calais.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> who was then Governour of <hi>Havre de Grace,</hi> finding the <hi>French</hi> well diſpoſed to betray the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in that Town into the hands of their Country-men, and that they had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into a Conſpiracy to that purpoſe with the <hi>Rhinegrave,</hi> who lay not far off with ſome <hi>German</hi> Forces: He thereupon turn'd all the <hi>French</hi> both Proteſtants and Papiſts out of the Town without any difference, and ſeized upon all their Ships. The <hi>French</hi> thereupon (without ever reflecting on their own Conſpiracy againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi>) began a loud complaint, That the <hi>Engliſh</hi> came not to protect the <hi>French</hi> in their diſtreſſes, but to get the poſſeſſion of the Town, dealing with them not as with Brethren, but as Foreigners. And hereupon the <hi>French</hi> reſolved to take this place upon any terms from the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and the King ſent a Trumpet to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour to demand the Town; who returned for an Anſwer, <hi>That if the King of</hi> Spain <hi>would paſs his word that</hi> Calais <hi>ſhould be reſtored according to the Treaty of</hi> Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray, <hi>at the time by it appointed; and that the King of</hi> France, <hi>the Queen-Mother, and the Princes of the Blood Royal, would confirm the ſame by their Oaths, and Regiſter it in all the Parliaments of</hi> France, <hi>and then give them Hoſtages of the Prime Nobility of</hi> France, <hi>he would then deliver up the Town.</hi> This being rejected, the 22d. of <hi>July, Montmorency</hi> the <hi>Conſtable</hi> took the field, all things being by that time prepared to reduce it by force. The next day they ſummon'd the Town again. <hi>Warwick</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, he would ſuffer death rather than deliver up the place without the Queen's knowledge.

This Uproar was very great, and yet it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to the beſt advantage to the Queen, who was then out of Town; ſhe was very much incenſed, as ſhe had good reaſon, againſt theſe Zealots; and ſwore ſhe would ſhortly make them Examples of her Royal Indignation. The Earls of <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray</hi> and <hi>Glencarne</hi> however wiſely interpoſed and appeaſed her anger for the preſent. Soon after <hi>John Knox</hi> was call'd before the Council,

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:51585:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>Preacher of Rebellion, nor loved to ſtir up Tumults; contrariwiſe he always taught the People to obey their Magiſtrates and Princes in God. As to the Convocation of the Subjects, he had received from the Church a Command to advertiſe his Brethren when he ſaw a neceſſity of their Meeting, eſpecially if he ſaw Religion to be in peril: And had often deſired to be diſcharged of that burthen, but ſtill was refuſed.</hi> Then ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to the Queen with wonderful boldneſs:
<note place="margin">His bold An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</note> 
               <hi>He charged her in the name of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, as ſhe deſired to eſcape his heavy wrath and indignation, to forſake that Idolatrous Religion which ſhe profeſs'd, and by her power maintain'd againſt all the Statutes of the Realm.</hi> He was going on when the Earl of <hi>Morton,</hi> then Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor of <hi>Scotland,</hi> fearing the Queen might be yet more exaſperated againſt all the Proteſtants of her Kingdom, by his indiſcreet zeal, commanded him to hold his peace and go away. After this, things were carried more peaceably between the Queen and the Church, the Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> making it his buſineſs to propound their Petitions to her, and to return her Anſwers to them.</p>
